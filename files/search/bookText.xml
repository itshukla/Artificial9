                 “A year spent in artificial intelligence is enough to make one believe in God.”

                                                                                                           — Alan Perlis
                 Artificial Intelligence is the most talked-about subject and we all understand that the future lies in knowing
                 it well. It is a branch of Computer Science that simulates human intelligence into machines, especially in
                 computer systems, so that they can think and perform actions similar to humans.

                 Touchpad Artificial Intelligence series has some salient features such as AI Reboot, AI Deep Thinking, AI
                 in Life, AI Lab and AI Ready which ensures that NEP 2020 & NCF 2023 guidelines are followed. The series is
                 written keeping in mind about the future and scope that lies in Artificial Intelligence. The knowledge is spread
                 in a phased manner so that no student, irrespective of age, has difficulty understanding the theory.

                 There are some brainstorming activities in the form of AI Task in between the topics to ensure that students
                 give pause to their learning and use their skills to reach to some creative ideas in solving given problems.
                 Every chapter has competency-based questions as guided by CBSE to ensure that students are capable of
                 applying their learning to solve some real-life challenges. There are plenty of Video Sessions for students
                 and teachers to go beyond the syllabus and enrich their knowledge.

                 We would like to humbly acknowledge the support provided by our family, friends and Orange Education
                 team to accomplish this noble task.
                 We are sure that this book will prove to be a tool in making the students future ready for Artificial Intelligence.

                 Wishing learners great success in future endeavours. Enjoy the journey of happy learning!!

                 All your feedback and suggestions will always be wholeheartedly welcome to improve  and grow.

                 Communication is an age old method to convey any information effectively. In this unit, we will discuss different
                 ways of communication, which is very useful for a student to learn. If a person has good communication skills, then,
                 it becomes easy to convey a message in short and simple sentences. This develops confidence and helps a person
                 survive in the vast ocean of Information Technology (IT).


                         What is Communication?

                 The word 'communication' is derived from the Latin word communicare, meaning "to share". It is defined as a way
                 of conveying a meaningful message from one entity to another in the form of signs, symbols, behaviour, verbal,
                 and non-verbal skills. It is important that whatever we want to communicate is conveyed effectively.

                 Importance of Communication Skills
                 Communication is a two way process. It is an interchange of ideas or information from sender to receiver and vice
                 versa. Communication is important for many reasons mentioned below:

                    • Inform: Information is the most important reason for communication. Whenever there is a need to exchange
                   ideas or information in a group or an organisation, it can be done through words, signals, signs, gestures etc.
                   Information can also be gathered through personal interviews with prominent people. For example, a teacher
                   teaching in a class passes the information to the students in that class.
                    • Persuasion: It influences a person to perform a specific task. For example, a mother persuades her child to work
                   hard to score good grades in exams. A coach persuades his team to strongly face all the challenge in a match.

                    • Express Feeling: Talking about your  felling is the healthy  way  to express them. For example, sharing  your
                   excitement about doing well in your exams or sharing your feelings with your parents and friends.

                                                                                       Communication Skills-I   21]]></page><page Index="24"><![CDATA[Elements of Communication
              Communication is a two-way exchange of information, i.e., giving and receiving. Speaking and writing to someone
              are examples of giving information. Reading and listening to someone are examples of receiving information.

                                                                                        3. A Channel (or path) such

                                                        Elements of Communication
              The basic elements of communication are:

                 • Sender: The sender sends a message either in the form of giving information or asking for information. The
                sender can be any person, group, or an organisation who initiates the process of communication. The sender's
                knowledge, experiences, and skills influence the quality of the message.
                 • Ideas/Messages: This message can be in the form of an idea or any information that a sender wishes to convey
                or asking for information from the receiver. The message is encoded i.e. created in the form of text, sign symbols
                which the receiver decodes or understands to find out its actual meaning.
                 • Communication Channel: It is the medium through which a message can be sent. It can be conveyed through
                oral, written or visual methods. These days, technology plays an important role in transmitting information
                through mediums such as email, voicemail, social media websites, etc.
                 • Receiver: A receiver can be any person, group, or an organisation who interprets the message conveyed by a
                sender. The receiver has to extract the meaning from the text, signs or symbols sent by the sender and find out
                its actual meaning.
                 • Feedback: It is the receiver's acknowledgement and response to the message for ensuring that they understood
                each other correctly.

                       Perspectives in Communication

              Perspective  is  the  fixed  idea  or  thinking  that  influence  how  we  communicate.  Whether  we  are  the  sender  or
              receiver of a message, our perspective can impact how we interpret that message, potentially altering its intended
              meaning. Let us assume that a teacher wanting to teach a difficult topic in a simplified way is not understood by the
              students, as the students assumed that the topic was too difficult to understand. This perspective of the students,
              that the topic is difficult, did not allow the students to understand despite the teacher's effort to make it simple.

              Factors Affecting Perspectives in Communication
              We face this problem of conveying and understanding the message due to some problems in our communication.
              Some of the factors that affect the perspectives in our communication are:
                 • Language: It is a very important factor that affects communication. Sometimes we are not familiar with the
                language in which we wish to communicate. Using wrong words at wrong places may alter the meaning of the
                message and thus do not solve the purpose of effective communication.

                   solving the jigsaw puzzle based on the visual information processed by our brain.
                    • Past Experience: Our past experience influences our communication both as sender and receiver. For example, if a
                   student scores bad grades in one test, he may lose his confidence and do not perform well in his next test.
                    • Prejudice: It is a preconceived idea, which can be favourable or unfavourable towards a person or a thing.
                    • Feelings: A sender or a receiver's feelings are very important for effective communication. If a sender is feeling
                   low, then, the person will not be able to deliver the message appropriately. In case a receiver is feeling out of
                   the place, he will not be able to perceive a meaningful message.
                    • Environment: If the surrounding area of the communication is imbalanced, then, the impact of the communication
                   will not be much. Fear, anxiety, aggression, etc. strongly affect the communication skills.
                    • Culture: Different cultures interpret common signs, symbols and words with different meanings thus altering
                   the overall meaning of effective communication.

                         Effective ways of Communication

                 In order to ensure the communication is effective and engaging, we need to have a clear vision of 7 C's as discussed
                 below:
                    • Clear: The content of the message you wish to communicate should be straight and clear so that it is easy to
                   understand and interpret correctly.
                    • Concise: The message should be short and precise. Instead of using long sentences or paragraphs, we should
                   focus on short sentences to convey our message.
                    • Concrete: The content should be clear in words with the direct focus on the message.

                    • Correct: The use of correct words, sentences, and grammar in whichever language you follow to communicate
                   is very important.
                    • Coherent: The content of the message should stick to the topic and should flow in a sequence that makes sense.

                    • Complete: The message should be complete with all the required information for a necessary action.
                    • Courteous: The message should be ethically and politely conveyed, with no hidden insult or aggravated tone.


                         Types of Communication

                 There are mainly three types of communication: verbal, non-verbal, and visual. Let us discuss these in detail.

                                                                               Verbal



                                                  Types of
                                               Communication                    Non-verbal



                                                                               Visual

                 Verbal
                 Verbal Communication is using the words, sentences, and grammar of a specific language that can be spoken or
                 written to share information with other people or an organisation. It is the most common method of communication.
                 Proper body language, voice modulation, and polite tone enhance the impact of verbal communication.

                 Types of Verbal Communication
                 There are two kinds of verbal communication: Oral and Written.

                                                                                       Communication Skills-I   23]]></page><page Index="26"><![CDATA[Oral or Spoken Communication
              Oral communication is communication using spoken words in an interactive way to share ideas or information. It
              can be a direct face-to-face conversation or a telephonic conversation.
              Doing a presentation in a conference, conversing across a round table conference, or speaking to address the
              audience giving lectures by a teacher in a class are all examples of oral or spoken communication.
























              Following are the advantages of oral communication:
                 • Direct and interactive method of communication where the impact is spontaneous.
                 • It is time saving.
                 • Easy way to exchange ideas.

              Following are the disadvantages of oral communication:
                 • It is less authentic as it is an informal way of communication.

                 • It is sometimes unproductive.
                 • If a common language is not a medium, then, using some words may have different meanings in different
                 languages, which may alter the actual meaning of the message you wish to communicate.
              Written Communication
              Written  communication  is  communication  using  written  words  to  share  ideas  or  information.  Sending  short
              messages through phones, writing letters, sending emails, making notes, or writing down speech to communicate,
              spreading information through books and magazines are a few examples of written communication.

              Following are the advantages of written communication:
                 • It is an effective way of communication where the message can be stored for future references.
                 • It is impact-full and effective.

                 • It is easy to understand and interpret.
              Following are the disadvantages of written communication:
                 • It is time consuming as feedback is not immediate.
                 • It costs more in terms of resources and manpower.
                 • It requires one to have a proper command over a written language.


              Non-Verbal
              Non-verbal communication is defined as communication through physical and physiological cues without using spoken
              or written words. The information is transmitted using body language, touch, facial expressions, symbols, signals, etc.

                    24      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-IX]]></page><page Index="27"><![CDATA[Most of our communication with the people around us throughout the day is non-verbal, and most of the time we
                 are not aware of it. It is helpful when trying to understand others' thoughts and feelings.
                 When you are not interested in what the teacher is teaching in the class, you start looking around, disturb the
                 person sitting next to you, fiddle with a pen or paper, and observe little things in the class. Without using words
                 you are able to give the message to your teacher that lesson is very boring and you are not interested.
                 There are different types of non-verbal communication. Let us discuss about them.


                 Facial Expressions
                 Facial expressions are a very powerful way of conveying different forms of feelings and emotions. For effective
                 non-verbal communication, you should smile when you meet someone, match your expressions with your words,
                 and nod while listening. Being aware of your own facial expressions is very important in a professional environment.
                 In one of the studies, it was found that the most trustworthy facial expression involved a slight rise of the eyebrows
                 and a slight smile. Six basic facial expressions are—anger, fear, happy, disgust, sad, and surprise.


                 Body Language and Gestures
                 Body language means the position, gestures, and movement of the body to convey and interpret the attitude and
                 feelings of a person. Positive body language can help you get what you want, if you know how to use it, whereas
                 negative body language can make you miss out on opportunities or offend people you want to impress. One
                 theory on the origin of human language is called "Gestural Theory", which conveys that, speech originated from
                 gestures. Some of the common body languages and gestures are:

                    • Arms or legs across the chest.
                    • Rubbing or moving hands around.
                    • Standing with your hands clasped behind your back.
                    • Playing with your hair or nose.

                    • Putting your head in your hands.



                              Brainy Fact



                        The first modern book on body language appeared more than 350 years ago.




                 Eye Contact
                 Keeping a proper eye contact shows you are mentally present and
                 actively involved in communication. The way you look at someone
                 will reflect some of the strongest emotions and feelings during
                 a social conversation. Rolling your eyes expresses displeasure or
                 unhappiness with a situation. Eye contact helps you:
                    • Facilitate the connection with your audience in a meeting,
                   conference, presentation, etc.
                    • Improve your concentration.
                    • Give confidence and authority.
                    • Retain the important points of conversation.
                    • Express your emotions like sadness, happiness, surprise, fear, etc.

              Body posture is the position of the human body and its alignment and orientation with respect to non-verbal
              communication. During a conversation, the way you sit or stand and communicate your body postures to others
              depends a lot on your attitude and emotional state. Before you start a conversation, standing straight and holding
              your head high will have a great impact on the crowd.
              The correct body postures for effective non-verbal communication are:
                 • Keep your shoulders straight and body relaxed.

                 • Sit straight while resting your hands and feet in a relaxed position.
                 • While standing, keep your hands by your sides.


              Appearance
              Appearance includes our choice of colour, body cleanliness, properly dressed, hairstyle, etc. When you are speaking
              in public, you may be representing your organisation or just yourself. You should ensure that you are properly and
              neatly dressed. It also increases your self-confidence and you will definitely feel good about yourself.


              Personal Space and Proximity
              Personal space refers to the appropriate distance during a conversation or space surrounding each person. Factors
              like regional culture, gender, age, ethnicity, or topic of conversation affects a personal distance. For example, while
              going on a lift, if a stranger enters, we feel uncomfortable and try making no eye contact and acting busy. Similarly,
              if a classmate sits on your seat, you will try your best to convince him to go to some other place as we have a claim
              to our own space and have a sense of control over it.


              Paralanguage
              Paralanguage includes aspects such as tone of voice, loudness, speed of speech, pausing, and even silence. This
              helps you understand the context and the meaning of the words used in the communication.
              A cold tone of voice might suggest that you are actually not fine and don't wish to discuss it. A bright and happy
              tone of voice will reveal that you are happy with the things going around in your life. Silence or vocal pauses can
              communicate hesitation, the need to gather thought or serve as a sign of respect.


              Haptics/Touch
              Haptics is the power of touch in communication. Each touch conveys emotions and feelings in a physical form
              with a unique message like fear, disgust, love, encouragement, gratitude, sympathy, anger, pain, violence, etc.
              Studies have shown that it plays a very important role in the proper development of babies, and in animals, it
              works as a sign of love and care. You may begin your interaction with people by shaking hands and having casual
              conversation. This interaction can help establish trust before you start addressing your audience.

              Advantages of Non-Verbal Communication
              Some of the advantages of non-verbal communication are:

                 • It is used as complimentary with verbal communication to enhance the effect of communication.
                 • Information can  be easily presented in non-verbal communication through  gesture, body  language,  etc.
                For example, teacher with a finger on the lips conveys not to talk and sit quietly, to the whole class. A person
                addressing a crowd uses voice modulation to get the attention of the crowd. Sometimes nodding your head to
                say yes is enough to convey the message.

                   and physically challenged, especially with hearing and speaking problems.
                    • It is useful and easy method of communication where no common language is required to master.
                    • It is a fast method of communication as gestures have more impact than words.


                 Disadvantages of Non-Verbal Communication
                 Some of the disadvantages of non-verbal communication are:
                    • Since it uses gestures, facial expressions, eye contact, touch, signs, sound, etc. for communication, there are
                   chances of misinterpretation of the message required to be delivered.
                    • Different  cultures  use  different  ways  of  non-verbal  communication.  The  difference  in  message  can  lead  to
                   negativity and offense. For example, people who speak less and are less interactive are considered cold and
                   arrogant. However, the Japanese admire silence and consider it as a key to success.
                    • It does not follow any rules or structures, therefore people unconsciously may engage in non-verbal movements
                   which are considered offensive.
                    • It is not  suitable for  long and  lengthy  messages  as the  actual  message may get  lost in a lengthy  and
                   time-consuming conversation.
                    • Sometimes  it  is  an  incomplete  form  of  communication  and  needs  a  support  of  verbal  communication  for
                   effective and meaningful delivery of a message.

                    • Distant communication is not possible using non-verbal communication.

                 Visual Communication
                 Another important method of communication is visual communication, which involves sending and understanding
                 messages only through images or pictures. The main advantage of this type of communication is that you do not
                 need to know any particular language for understanding it. It is simple, easy to understand and remain the same
                 across different places. Some common types of visual communication are:


                  Traffic symbol which                                 Traffic  Lights—Red  for  Stop,

              Greetings is the salutation used to welcome or greet a person. Greetings are an
              essential part of human communication and can vary greatly depending on who
              we are talking to and even according to the time of the day. The greeting and reply
              to a greeting at work is different from the greeting and reply given to a friend.
              Similarly, there are many ways to say goodbye when you depart.

              Types of Greetings
              Greetings serve to show people that you are happy to meet or see them and can
              be used in both formal and informal ways.
                 • Formal greetings are used with courtesy, and respect to communicate with someone meeting for the first time.
                It is generally a formal way to greet senior, elderly people. This is used in professional environments like in
                schools, colleges and offices. Formal greetings often involve a verbal acknowledgment  and sometimes  a
                handshake, with appropriate facial expression, gestures, body language, and eye contact.
                Some of the examples of the formal greetings are:

                   ✶ Greetings from the teacher: Good morning, everybody!              Hello!
                   ✶ Reply by students: Good morning, Ma'am!                                             How are you?
                   ✶ Greetings from the students: Good morning, Sir!
                   ✶ Reply by teacher: Good morning, everyone!                  Good Afternoon             Pleased to
                                                                                                           meet you
                   ✶ Greetings from an Employee: Hello Sir. How are you?
                   ✶ Reply by the Senior: Very well. Thank you! How are you?
                 • Informal greetings are casual and relaxed ways of acknowledging
                or welcoming someone, often used in social or personal settings.           Hi!
                It  is  generally  used  for  casual  events,  such as parties, social                        Hey
                gatherings, or when meeting someone in a relaxed setting.

                Some of the examples of the informal greetings are:                  What's new?            How's life?
                   ✶ Greetings from Friend 1: Hi!
                   ✶ Reply by Friend 2: Hey!
                   ✶ Greetings from Brother: Hey! How are you doing?
                   ✶ Reply by Sister: Hi! I am doing great!
                 • Greetings according to time refer to the different ways of greeting
                someone depending on the time of day. For example, "Good morning"           I am          I am Sonia,
                is a common greeting used in the morning, while "Good afternoon"          Anirudh        from Mumbai
                is used in the afternoon, and "Good evening" is used in the evening.
                These greetings are a polite and respectful way of acknowledging
                someone and are often used in both formal and informal settings.
                 • You should "introduce" yourself to people you are meeting for the
                first time or to those who are interested in learning more about you.
                This can be accomplished by simply  stating your name and some
                general details such as your hometown, employment, courses taken
                in school, hobbies, etc. Always remember to smile and look the other
                person in the eye when introducing oneself.




                    28      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-IX]]></page><page Index="31"><![CDATA[• A person can be introduced to others by telling them their name, what they do, how we got to know them, or
                   simply just sharing some interesting information about them.
                                                               This is my friend

                         Talking about Yourself


                 Talking about  yourself is a fundamental  part of communication,  whether  you're introducing  yourself to new
                 people, participating in an interview, or simply making conversation. Being able to effectively and confidently talk
                 about yourself can help you make a positive impression and build meaningful connections.

                 You usually start by telling your name. Then you can talk about other things, such as what you do, your age, where
                 you live, or even about the things or activities that you like or dislike. For all these sentences, you will use nouns and
                 verbs.

                 A noun is a 'naming' word that is used for a person, place, thing, or idea. Some examples of nouns are Amaira,
                 Delhi, Cricket and painting.

                 A verb is a 'doing' word that tells us what the noun does. Some examples of verbs are play, like, eat, and write.
                 Note that some verbs with an 'ing' ending can also act as nouns. Swimming is an example. We can talk about likes
                 and dislikes using nouns as well as verbs that end with 'ing'. For example, cycling and swimming.


                 Structuring Your Self-Introduction
                 To make sure your introduction is clear and interesting, follow these easy steps:
                 1. Start with a Greeting: Begin by saying hello in a polite way that fits the situation.

                   Example: "Hi everyone!" or "Good morning!" or "Hi "
                 2. Introduce Yourself: Say your name and a little bit about who you are.
                   Example: "My name is Akshaj, and I'm from Delhi."
                 3.  Expand on Key Points: Talk a bit more about important parts of your life, like your job, what you study, your
                   hobbies, skills, and what you hope to do in the future.

                   Example: "I work as a Software Expert at Tech Point.
                            In my free time, I love hiking and cooking.
                            I'm good at organising events and helping others.
                            In the future, I hope to become an Entrepreneur with my own Tech Company."
                 4.  Share a Personal Touch: Add something unique about you, like an interesting experience or something you
                   care about.
                   Example:  "One of my favorite experiences was volunteering in a training camp for physically challenged children
                            in Mumbai. I believe in the importance of giving back to the community."



                                                                                       Communication Skills-I   29]]></page><page Index="32"><![CDATA[5. Conclude: Finish with a positive note, showing you're happy to be there or excited about the opportunity.
                Example: "I'm really excited to be here today and look forward to getting to know all of you."
              Another example of introducing yourself when going for a job interview:
              "Hello, my name is Riya Singh. I'm from Bengaluru and work as a digital marketing specialist with over six years of
              experience. I graduated from Delhi University with a degree in communications. In my current role, I specialise in
              social media strategy and content creation. Outside of work, I enjoy painting and volunteering at animal shelters.
              My goal is to lead a marketing team at a leading tech company."


              Filling a Form
              A form is a typed or printed page with blank spaces for information. Filling out a form means giving the information
              needed in the right places at the time of, applying for a job, filling a registration form or taking a survey. Each form
              is different, so you should read it properly before filling. Write neatly, taking care to use the correct spellings. It's
              important to take your time and double-check everything to avoid any errors.
              A form usually has the following common fields where filling of the personal information is required.
                 • Name: It can be full name or in the form of first name, middle name, last name. It is always advisable to fill this
                in uppercase to avoid writing in a running hand and reduce the chances of making mistakes.
                 • Date of birth: It represents your date of birth in the given format - DD/MM/YYYY.
                 • Address: This is the postal address which includes your house number and the details of the street, area, and
                the city.
                 • PIN code: This is a group of numbers used by the post office to identify a region. It is an important part of an address.

                 • Contact Information: This includes your phone number and email address.
                 • Signature and Date: Most forms require a signature to confirm, the information provided is true and correct.
                Sign and date the form in the designated areas. Signature is your name or initials written by hand, in a specific
                way (which is difficult for anyone else to copy).

                       3P's of Public Speaking


              Public speaking is speaking formally in front of a live audience. This can be giving a speech on a stage in front of
              a huge audience or giving a lecture in a class. It is a skill that you master only when you have command over a
              language with a pleasing personality and the ability to engage your audience with proper voice modulation. Most
              of the people have anxiety and feel nervous before going on stage. Let us study the power of 3P's which will help
              us to overcome our fears and make us an effective speaker.


              Prepare
              Prepare the content of your speech. Think about what your audience is expecting you to speak and then plan your
              content. Make it interesting in such a way that your audience feel engaged and are full of praises for you.

              Practice
              Rehearse out loud your speech before your D-day. Work to control your voice modulation, make a list of few filler
              words and plan your body movements and hand gestures. Practice, pause, and breathe. Use a clock to check your
              timings and allow time for the unexpected.


              Perform
              If you have done the preparation and practiced well, then, half of your battle is won. Just be confident of yourself
              and do not feel nervous.

                 Writing skill is an important part of communication. It is an ability to express your ideas or thoughts. A good
                 writing skill uses perfect words to express the accurate meaning of the message with more clarity. For this, a good
                 command over a language plays a very important role. Let us study about various aspects which are important for
                 having writing skills.

                 Capitalisation

                 Capitalisation means writing the first alphabet of a word in uppercase. In English grammar, we cannot decide on
                 our own to write anything in capital. We follow the rules of capitalisation whenever we write anything. It gives
                 emphasis on certain words used at different places.

                 Some of the basic rules of capitalisation which we all should remember in our basic writing skills are listed below:
                    • Beginning of a sentence: It is marked by capitalising the first letter in a sentence. For example:
                      ✶ My computer class is very interesting.
                      ✶ We are going for a movie today.
                    • Proper Nouns: Capitalise the first letter of a proper noun like name of a person, place or an organisation.
                   For example:
                      ✶ New Delhi is the capital of India.
                      ✶ My friend Rohit loves to play cricket.

                    • Days of week, months, and holidays: Always remember to capitalise the first letter of days of week like Sunday,
                   Monday, etc., months like June, August, etc., and holidays/festivals like Republic Day, Diwali, etc., but not the
                   seasons like winter, spring, summer, etc. Let us look at an example:
                      ✶ Every year Republic Day is celebrated in India on 26 January.

                    • The Pronoun "I": Pronoun "I" is a reference to yourself and should always be capitalised. For example:
                      ✶ Reema and I are going for a picnic.
                      ✶ I love to read books before I go to sleep.
                    • Directions: The directions like North, South, etc. are written in capital only when they are referred to as locations.
                   For example:
                      ✶ I am heading towards South.
                    • Titles that appear before names: The titles like President, Principal, Mr., Captain, etc. that appear before names
                   are written with the first letter in capital. For example:
                      ✶ Mr. Singh is a good man.

                      ✶ President Peter gave a wonderful speech.

                 Punctuation Marks
                 These are the symbols used to help the reader understand the proper meaning of a sentence and where to pause
                 or stop. Let us learn about some of the punctuation marks in detail.


                 Full Stop or Period (.)
                 Full stop or period is used at the end of a sentence. We also use it to shorten a word to form an abbreviation. For
                 example, Mr. for Mister, Col. for Colonel.

              Exclamation Mark (!)
              Exclamation mark is used in a sentence to strongly express a feeling of happiness, sorrow, love, surprise etc. For example:

                 • Wow! Such a pretty dress.
                 • Oh! You got hurt badly.


              Comma (,)
              Comma is used to mark a pause in a sentence.
              Any list of items mentioned in a sentence are separated by a comma. For example:
                 • I want a dress, shoes, watch, and a box of chocolate for my birthday.
              It is sometimes used to separate two adjectives in a sentence. For example:

                 • I have a brown, fluffy golden retriever.
              A sentence with the location specified has a city separated by a comma from the state. For example:
                 • Mahatma Gandhi was born in Porbandar, Gujrat.
              When somebody is addressed in a direct speech. For example:
                 • Hi Swati, how is your job going on?


              Apostrophe (')
              Apostrophe can be used to indicate the omission of some letters in a word. For example:
                 • I'm enjoying my friend's company.

                 • It's very hot outside.
              It is used to show the possession of a thing. For example:
                 • Adrissa's eyes are blue in colour.


                       Phrases

              Phrase is a group of words together, but not a sentence that forms a complete meaning. It lacks the subject and
              the object. For example:
                 • On the roof
                 • Sleeping now

                 • Cannot eat
                 • Trying hard

                 A sentence is a group of words arranged together and has a complete meaning. For example:

                    • I am reading a book.
                    • She went to school.
                    • My mother cooks good food.


                 Rules for Writing a Sentence
                 Following are the rules for writing a sentence:
                    • It begins with a capital letter.
                    • It ends with a full stop, exclamation mark, or question mark depending on the type of a sentence.
                    • It must contain one subject and one verb with an independent clause.

                    • It should have a meaning.

                 Parts of a Sentence

                 The two most basic parts of a sentence are subject and a predicate. Let us study about them.

                 Subject
                 A subject refers to a person performing an action. It tells us, what the sentence is all about. For example:

                    • Simmi loves cakes.
                    • My dog runs very fast.

                 Predicate

                 Predicate contains a verb that makes a statement about the subject. For example:
                    • My teacher marked me absent.
                    • Shweta dances very well.


                 Types of Objects
                 The object in a sentence can be either direct or indirect.
                    • Direct: Direct objects are the ones directly 'acted on' by the action word (verb). It answers the question "what?"
                   or "whom?" after the verb. For example:
                      ✶ She read a book.
                    ○ What did she read? A book.
                      ✶ The teacher called the student.
                    ○ Whom did the teacher call? The student.
                    • Indirect: An indirect object is the noun or pronoun that receives the benefit of the action, or to whom, or for
                   whom the action is done. It answers questions, such as 'to whom' and 'for whom'. For example:

                      ✶ She gave her friend a gift.
                    ○ To whom did she give a gift? Her friend.
                      ✶ The teacher sent the student an email.
                    ○ To whom did the teacher send an email? The student.



                                                                                       Communication Skills-I   33]]></page><page Index="36"><![CDATA[Examples with Both Direct and Indirect Objects
                 • He sent her a letter.
                   ✶ Verb: sent
                   ✶ Direct object: a letter (What did he send? A letter)
                   ✶ Indirect object: her (To whom did he send a letter? Her)
                 • She baked her brother a cake.

                   ✶ Verb: baked
                   ✶ Direct object: a cake (What did she bake? A cake)
                   ✶ Indirect object: her brother (For whom did she bake a cake? Her brother)

              Types of Sentences
              There are four types of sentences as explained below:

                 • Declarative/Assertive sentence: A sentence which gives information and makes a bold statement. It may state
                 a fact. Most of the sentences of English language are assertive sentences. For example:
                   ✶ Monalisa is a beautiful girl.
                   ✶ Kohli is an excellent batsman.

                 • Imperative sentence: A sentence that makes a request or gives an order, an advice, or a command. For example:
                   ✶ Don't eat junk food.
                   ✶ Do not eat medicine on an empty stomach.
                 • Interrogative sentence: A sentence that asks a direct question and ends with a question mark(?). For example:
                   ✶ Are you hungry?

                   ✶ Where do you live?
                 • Exclamatory sentence: A sentence that shows an excitement or a strong feeling. It ends with an exclamation
                 mark (!). For example:
                   ✶ Wow! You dance so well.
                   ✶ Your grades are excellent. Congratulations!


              Active and Passive Sentence
              In English, sentences can be structured in either the active or passive voice. Understanding the difference between
              these two can help give you more confidence in writing in English. So let's do few sentences and understand the
              importance of active and passive sentences in English language:

              Active Voice

              Sentences where the subject takes an action are known to be in the active voice. This structure is straightforward
              and often more dynamic and clear.


              Structure
                 • Subject + Verb + Object
              Examples:

                 • She (subject) wrote (verb) a letter (object).
                 • Neha (subject) played(verb) a piano (object).
                 • The cat (subject) chased (verb) the mouse (object).

                 Sentences in which the subject receives an action are known to be in the passive voice. This structure can be useful
                 when the focus is on the action itself or the recipient of the action, rather than, who performed the action.


                 Structure
                    • Object of the active sentence becomes the subject + Form of "to be" + Past participle + by + Agent
                 Examples:
                    • A letter (subject) was written (verb) by her (agent).

                    • The piano (subject) was played (verb) by Neha (agent).
                    • The mouse (subject) was chased (verb) by the cat (agent).


                         Parts of Speech

                 A sentence is made up of words. Every word has a specific function to play in a sentence to make it meaningful. It
                 falls into different categories to play a different role in a sentence. These categories are called the Parts of Speech.
                 It is important to learn these different parts of speech to understand the language well, to help you construct good
                 sentences for effective communication.

                                                                  Noun

                      ✶ My pen is broken.

                    • Pronoun: Pronoun is a word that replaces a noun. They are used to avoid the repetition of nouns, so that, the
                   sentences are smoother and effective. For example:
                      ✶ She likes to play in sand on the seashore.
                      ✶ It is our duty to keep our city clean.
                    • Verbs: Verbs are "doing words". It can be a word or a group of words that describes an action or a state of being.
                   For example:
                      ✶ Shruti danced to celebrate my victory.
                      ✶ Gardener plucked the flower.
                    • Adverbs: Adverb is a word that describes a verb, an adjective or another adverb. It also tells how an action was
                   done. For example:
                      ✶ John never participated in conversation.
                      ✶ Keep the book on the table placed there.

                   ✶ I have a beautiful dress.
                   ✶ My smart dog runs on a smooth road.
                 • Conjunction: Conjunction is a word that joins words, phrases, clauses, or sentences together. There are different
                types of conjunctions. Some conjunctions may be used to make a list while some may be used to connect
                thoughts, ideas or actions. For example:

                 • Interjection: An interjection is a word or a phrase that expresses a sudden or a strong feeling. Grammatically
                they are not related in a sentence but expresses a relationship between a word and a phrase in a sentence.
                Sometimes they are followed by an exclamation mark(!). For example:
                   ✶ Alas! I am so lost without you.
                   ✶ Great! You are coming with me.

                       Use of Articles

              An article is a word that describes a noun. It is used before a noun to show whether it is specific or not. In English
              grammar there are three articles— A, An, The. They fall into the following two categories: definite and indefinite.


              Definite— The
              "THE" is a definite article which is used before a noun that indicates something clear or obvious. For example:
                 • The sun shines bright today.
                 • Give me the book on the table.

                 • The air quality is very bad in this place.

              Indefinite— A, An
                 • 'A' and 'An' are indefinite articles which are used before a noun that are not specific or known before. "A" is used
                before a word beginning with a consonant (alphabets other than vowels) sound. For example:

                   ✶ A book (it can be any book)
                   ✶ A game (it can be any game)
                 • "An" is used before a word that begins with a vowel(a, e, i, o, u) sound. For example, an umbrella, an hour, an ice
                cream cone, etc.

                       When no Articles are used


                 • For common/general things. For example:
                   ✶ Fruits are good for health.
                   ✶ Do not eat medicines without doctor's prescription.
                 • Before a country, continent, island, mountain and lake' name. For example:
                   ✶ New Delhi is the capital of India.
                   ✶ Nagpur is famous for oranges.

                      ✶ I like swimming.
                      ✶ My friend plays tennis very well.


                         Construction of a Paragraph

                 A paragraph is made up of multiple sentences with a common theme. It begins with an introduction of a theme,
                 followed by sentences describing the theme and ends with a statement supporting the common idea. For example,
                 I love to travel. In the last two years, I have visited many places in India and abroad. I feel that travelling rejuvenates
                 your mind and soul. It also gives us a clear picture of different cultures and people all across the world.


                 Rules for Writing a Paragraph
                 Following are the rules for writing a paragraph:
                    • It begins with a new line.

                    • The first line has an indentation.
                    • It focuses on a main theme.

                         Pronunciation Basics

                 Pronunciation in English means how we say words, just as spelling is how you write a word. The first step in
                 pronunciation practice is to understand that each language has its own unique set of sounds. Proper pronunciation
                 is very important for clear communication. It helps people understand each other better. If we do not say (or
                 pronounce) words correctly, others will not understand what we are saying. Correct pronunciation will help you
                 express yourself in a clear and confident manner.

                 Here are the main parts of pronunciation.
                    • Phonemes: The individual sounds that make up words in a language. For example:
                      ✶ /p/ as in "pat" and "cap"
                      ✶ /t/ as in "tap" and "bat"
                      ✶ /k/ as in "cat" and "kick"
                    • Stress: The emphasis we put on certain syllables or words. For example:
                      ✶ "Desert" (noun): DE-sert (a dry area of land)
                      ✶ "Desert" (verb): de-SERT (to abandon)


                                                                                       Communication Skills-I   37]]></page><page Index="40"><![CDATA[• Intonation: The rise and fall of our voice as we speak. For example:
                Used in yes-no questions: "Are you coming?" (The pitch rises at the end of the sentence)
                 • Rhythm: The pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables. For example:
                "The CAT is ON the MAT." (Stressed syllables: CAT, ON, MAT)


              Phonetics
              Phonetics is the study of the sounds that we make when we speak. We use sounds to speak. Every word is made up
              of one or more sounds. We put these sounds together to pronounce words. Phonetics is essential for understanding
              how languages use sound to convey meaning and for improving pronunciation in language learning. If you engage
              in phonetic exercises and training programs then it will help you enhance your pronunciation skills.
              The English alphabet has 26 letters, from A to Z. But each of these letters can be pronounced in different ways in
              different words. We use 26 letters to write in English. But, we use more than 26 sounds when we speak English. This
              is why, a word's spelling does not always match its pronunciation. Let us see some examples.

              Breakdown of Sounds

                 • Cat (/kæt/): The 'a' in "cat" is pronounced as a short vowel sound, /æ/, which is similar to ",s" in Hindi.
                 • Father (/ˈfɑːðər/): The 'a' in "father" is pronounced as a long vowel sound, /ɑː/, which can be approximated to
                 "vk" in Hindi.
                 • Name (/neɪm/): The 'a' in "name" forms part of a diphthong, /eɪ/, which is a combination of two vowel sounds,
                 similar to ",s" in Hindi.
                 • About (/əˈbaʊt/): The 'a' in "about" is pronounced as a schwa, /ə/, which is an unstressed and neutral sound,
                 often represented as "v" in Hindi.
              Let us take the letter 'a' for example. Read the words below aloud. The letter 'a' is pronounced differently in

              Importance of Phonetics
              By understanding and practicing phonetics, you can,
                 • Improve Pronunciation: It helps you learn the correct way to produce the sounds of English, leading to clearer
                 and more accurate speech.

                 • Enhance Listening Skills: It gives you a better platform to recognise and differentiate sounds thus improving
                 comprehension.

                 • Reduce Accent: It helps you gain awareness of how native speakers produce sounds, which helps in reducing
                 accents.
                 • Increase Confidence: It guides you in speaking with correct pronunciation and thus boosts the confidence in
                 communication.

              Types of Sounds
              In the English language the alphabets are not enough to match different types of sounds we make, when we speak.
              Let us take a closer look at the sounds we use. All English words are made of three basic types of sounds.

                   vowels can be pronounced in different ways. We make a vowel sound when we read a vowel in a word. For
                   example, we pronounce the letter 'i' in the word 'bit' by using a vowel sound. In Hindi, it is fcV
                    • Diphthongs (combination sound of two vowels): We make a diphthong sound when we combine two vowels.
                   Diphthongs start as one vowel sound and go to another. For example, the sound 'ou' in the word "house" is a
                   diphthong or a combination. In Hindi, it is gkÅl
                    • Consonants: A consonant sound is any sound that is neither a vowel nor a diphthong sound. For example, we
                   use consonant sounds to say the letters 'p' and 't' in the word Pot. In Hindi, it is ikWV

                 Some more examples of different sounds are given in the table below:

                         Asking Questions-I

                 A question is a sentence, phrase, or word that either asks for information, or is used to test someone's knowledge.
                 We always use a question mark (?) at the end of a question.

                 Do you sometimes feel afraid to ask questions? This is a common feeling, and it can stop you from getting the
                 information you need.

                 What Happens If You Don't Ask Questions at the Right Time?
                 If you don't ask questions when you need to, several things can happen:
                    • Confusion: You might not understand things correctly.

                    • Missed Information: You could miss important details or opportunities.
                    • Mistakes: Without clarification, you might make errors.
                    • Lack of Participation: In class or meetings, not asking questions can make you feel less involved.

              A question is a request for information. It could be any type of information, such as an answer to a question in the
              textbook, information about a person or a place or about how to do a task. Asking questions helps us to:

                 • gain new knowledge, get information.
                 • make sure that what we know is correct.
                 • avoid doubts, confusion, misunderstanding.
                 • start talking to people by asking about them and their ideas.


              How to Make Sure We have Complete Information?
              If you do not have information about how to reach a place, you will not be able to reach it. If you do not know how
              to do some work, you will not be able to complete it, unless you ask questions and get information. Asking all the
              correct questions at the right time is also important.
              The method of '5W+1H' is a simple and effective way to ensure that you gather all the essential information
              necessary for completing a task or understanding a situation thoroughly.
              For example, imagine you need to plan a class project. Using the '5W+1H' method, you would ask:
                 • Who will be part of the project team?

                 • What are the specific tasks and goals of the project?
                 • When is the deadline for completing different phases?
                 • Where will team meetings and project work take place?
                 • Why is this project important for the company or team?
                 • How will the team collaborate and execute the project tasks?

              By systematically answering these questions, you ensure that all necessary information is considered, helping you
              plan effectively and achieve success in your work. Here's how it works:

                 • Who: This is about figuring out who is involved in the task or who is responsible for doing it. For example, if it's
                a school project, you'd want to know who your group members are.
                 • What: This helps you understand exactly what needs to be done or what the task is about. For example, for a
                project, this could mean knowing what topics you need to research.
                 • When: This tells you the timeframe or deadline for completing the task. It helps you plan when you need to
                finish each part. For example, if the project is due next week, you need to know when to start working on it.
                 • Where: This specifies the location or place where the task will happen. For example, a physical place like a
                classroom or an online platform for a virtual meeting.
                 • Why: Understanding the reasons or purpose behind the task helps you see its importance. For example, to learn
                something new, help others, or achieve a specific goal.
                 • How: This is about the methods or steps you'll use to complete the task. It helps you plan out what you need to
                do and how you'll do it. For example, if you need to write a report, you'd think about how to gather information
                and how to structure your writing.


                       Asking Questions-II

              In our everyday conversations with others, we frequently need to ask questions and respond to them in order
              to gather information. Asking the right questions plays a crucial role in obtaining the right information we need.
              There are two basic types of questions: close-ended and open-ended.



                    40      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-IX]]></page><page Index="43"><![CDATA[Closed-Ended Questions
                 Closed-ended questions are those that can usually be answered with a simple "yes" or "no" or with a specific
                 piece of information. They often have a straightforward answer and the answer options are limited or closed. For
                 example:
                    • Are you coming to the party?

                    • Did you finish your homework?
                    • Have you been to Paris?


                 Framing Close-ended Questions
                 We can form close-ended questions by adding two types of auxiliary verbs (helping verbs):
                    • Basic Auxiliary Verbs
                   Be, Do, Have: These verbs help convey different aspects of the action or state in a sentence.
                    • Modal Auxiliary Verbs

                   Can, Shall, May, Should, Could: These verbs express possibility, necessity, permission, or ability.
                 Another way of framing close-ended questions is to take a sentence without the above words and place such
                 words before the subject. For example:
                                     Original Sentence                         With Auxiliary Verbs

                          They talk on the phone every day.        Do they talk on the phone every day?
                          They have finished their homework.       Have they finished their homework?

                          You share your lunch with your friends.  Could you share your lunch with your friends?

                 Sometimes the helping verb changes based on the subject, but the main verb remains unchanged. For example,
                 in the sentences and the questions below, the main verb (cook) remains unchanged, but the auxiliary verb (do)
                 changes based on the subject. For example:


                                       Original Sentence                        With Auxiliary Verbs

                            They cook delicious food.                  Do they cook delicious food?

                            He cooks dinner every evening.             Does he cook dinner every evening?

                 In some cases, we exchange the positions of the subject and the verb to create a close-ended question. We can
                 follow a similar method for sentences that already have auxiliary verbs.
                                       Original Sentence                    Exchanging Subject and Verb

                            She is studying for her exams.            Is she studying for her exams?
                            They have completed the project.          Have they completed the project?


                 Open-Ended Questions
                 Open-ended  questions  are  designed  to  encourage  more  detailed  and  expressive  responses.  They  cannot  be
                 answered with just a "yes" or "no" and often require more thought and explanation. Examples:
                    • What do you think about the new project?
                    • How did you feel about the movie?

                    • Can you tell me about your favourite vacation?


                                                                                       Communication Skills-I   41]]></page><page Index="44"><![CDATA[Framing Open-ended Questions
              Some questions are called open-ended because their answers are not limited or closed. They have to be answered
              with more information than just a "yes" or a "no". We can form open-ended questions by using question words,
              such as What, Why, Who, How, When and Where. For example:

                               Original Statement                                   With 5W1H
                   She traveled to India last summer.           Where did she travel last summer?

                   He visited his grandparents.                 Why did he visit his grandparents?
                   She bought groceries.                        What groceries did she buy?
                   They moved to a new city.                    When did they decide to move to a new city?

                   He completed the project ahead of schedule.  How did he complete the project ahead of schedule?

                   Ans.  A phrase is a group of words together but not a sentence that forms a complete meaning. It lacks a subject and the
                      object. For example, Good luck, Hot Lemon Tea.
                    6.   What are punctuation marks?
                   Ans.  Punctuation marks are the symbols used to help the reader understand the proper meaning of a sentence and where

                 B.  Long answer type questions:
                    1.   What are basic elements of communication? Explain them.
                   Ans.  The basic elements of communication are:
                      •  Sender: The sender sends a message either in the form of giving information or asking for information. The sender
                        can be any person, group or an organisation who initiates the process of communication. The sender's knowledge,
                        experiences and skills influence the quality of the message.
                      •  Ideas/Messages: This message can be in the form of an idea or any information a sender wishes to convey or asking
                        for information from the receiver.
                      •  Communication Channel: It is the medium through which a message can be sent. It can be through oral, written or
                        visual methods. These days, technology plays an important role in serving as an important medium of transmission
                        of information so we can send through email, voice mail, social websites, etc.

                                                                                       Communication Skills-I   45]]></page><page Index="48"><![CDATA[•  Receiver: A receiver can be any person, group or an organisation who interprets the message conveyed by a sender.
                      The receiver has to extract the meaning from the text, signs or symbols sent by the sender and find out its actual
                      meaning.
                    •  Feedback: It is the receiver's acknowledgement and response to the message for ensuring that they understood each
                      other correctly.

                  2.   Discuss the factors that affect perspectives in communication.
                Ans.  Some of the factors that affect the perspectives in our communication are:
                    •  Language: It is a very important factor that affects communication. Sometimes we are not familiar with the language
                      we wish to communicate. Using wrong words at wrong places may alter the meaning of the message and thus do not
                      solve the purpose of effective communication.
                    •  Visual Perception: It is the ability of the brain to interpret the message received through our eyes. For example,
                      solving the jigsaw puzzle based on the visual information processed by our brain.
                    •  Past Experience: Our past experience influences our communication both at the sender and at the receiver end. For
                      example, if a student scores bad grades in one test, he may lose his confidence and do not perform well in his next test.
                    •  Prejudice: It is a preconceived idea which can be favourable or unfavourable towards a person or a thing.
                    •  Feelings: A sender or a receiver's feelings are very important for effective communication. If a sender is feeling low,
                      then, the person will not be able to deliver the message appropriately. In case a receiver is feeling out of the place,
                      he will not be able to perceive a meaningful message.
                    •  Environment: If the surrounding area of the communication is imbalanced, then, the impact of the communication
                      will not be much. Fear, anxiety, aggression, etc. strongly affects the communication skills.
                    •  Culture: Different cultures interpret common signs, symbols and words with different meanings thus altering the
                      overall meaning of effective communication.
                  3.   Discuss effective ways of communication.
                Ans.  In order to ensure the communication is effective and engaging, we need to have a clear vision of 7 C's as discussed
                    below:
                    •  Clear: The content of the message you wish to communicate should be straight  and  clear  so that  it is easy to
                      understand and interpret correctly.
                    •  Concise: The message should be short and precise. Instead of using long sentences or paragraphs we should focus
                      on short sentences to convey our message.
                    •  Concrete: The content is clear in words with the direct focus on the message.
                    •  Correct: Use of correct words, sentences, grammar of whichever language you follow to communicate.
                    •  Coherent: The content of the message should stick to the topic and should flow in a sequence that makes sense.
                    •  Complete: The message should be complete with all the required information for a necessary action.
                    •  Courteous: Messages should be ethically and politely conveyed, with no hidden insult and aggravated tone.
                  4.   What is a paragraph? Write the rules for writing a paragraph?
                Ans.  A paragraph is made up of multiple sentences with a common theme. It begins with an introduction of a theme,
                    followed by sentences describing the theme and ends with a statement supporting the common idea. For example,
                    I love to travel. In the last two years, I have visited many places in India and abroad. I feel that travelling rejuvenates your
                    mind and soul. It also gives us a clear picture of different cultures and people all across the world.
                    Following are the rules for writing a paragraph:
                    •  It begins on a new line.
                    •  The first line has an indentation.
                    •  It focuses on the main theme.
                  5.   Explain the different types of sentences.
                Ans.  There are four types of sentences as explained below:
                    a.   Declarative/assertive sentence: A sentence which gives information and marks a bold statement. It may state a
                       fact. Most of the sentences of English language are assertive sentences.
                      For example, God is great.
                    b.   Imperative sentence: A sentence that makes a request or gives an order, an advice or a command.
                      For example, Don't use a pen to draw diagrams.

                         mark (!).

                             Step 1  Teacher distributes half a sheet of paper to all students.
                             Step 2   Teacher instructs them not to ask any questions or look at others what they are doing. Teacher
                                     gives few instructions, like fold the paper (without telling which way), tear a corner (without
                                     telling  which  corner  upper  right/upper  left/bottom  right/bottom  left)  make  a  small  hole

                             communication. They understand the importance of two-way communication, which allows the receiver
                             to ask questions from sender for better clarity.

                 We work hard every day to manage our personal and professional lives. Every day is like a small battle. Only when
                 we plan our day, we can achieve our goals. Learning the skills of self-management is an essential task for students
                 in the 21st century. Students with strong self-management skills arrive to class prepared, pay attention, follow
                 directions, and work independently with focus. Let us study now how we can learn this skill to achieve our short
                 term and long term goals.


                         Self-Management


                 In simple language, self-management means managing yourself. It’s taking the responsibility of managing our
                 own  behaviour  and  actions. It is basically the ability to organise yourself with positive energy for  the overall
                 development in professional, personal, and social life. After every exam we often say this to ourselves that next
                 time I will study hard and do well.

              Self-management helps you to have a good control on your strength and weakness. Nothing can make you sad or
              unhappy unless you allow your emotions to flow in that direction. It is the process of preparing for the future. We
              have the following positive impacts on us with strong self-management skills.
              Let us study a few of them:
                 • It helps in the overall development of a person.

                 • It polishes your skills and enhances your employability with better career prospects.
                 • It makes you realise  your potential and maximises  your productivity that helps you grow personally and
                professionally.
                 • It brings strong organisational skills that help you streamline your work.
                 • It helps you to have a good control on your good and bad emotions in such a way that your mind rules you,
                and not your emotions.
                 • It is always result oriented.
                 • It helps you stay focused on your goals.

                 • It makes you a responsible person as you are accountable to yourself for your efforts and hard work.
                 • It develops strong competitive spirit so that we are able to handle it in a healthy manner.
                 • It develops self-confidence as we trust our own abilities.


                       Self-Management Skills


              Self-management skill is the ability to regulate your feelings and actions to achieve your goals independently and
              helps in the development of a strong personality. Some of the important self-management skills are discussed
              below:

                 • Self-Awareness: It is the awareness of your own personality. It is the ability to notice your feelings, your physical
                sensations, your reactions, your habits, your behaviours, and your thoughts. It enables you to learn about yourself
                in a way no one else can ever teach you. For example, as an individual, we are aware of artistic skills. If, I am good
                at fine arts, I will surely volunteer to participate in drawing competition.

                 • Self-Confidence: It is the trust in your own abilities, qualities and judgment. Some people are born with it and
                some learn to build up after facing the challenges of life. When you learn how to be confident, you can use it in
                your everyday life to tackle all of your goals. You can do any task that is given to you and not scared of taking
                risks. For example, it’s a sense of self-confidence that takes a person on stage to speak in a public gathering.
                 • Self-Motivation:  It  is the  force  that  drives you  to  do  the  things.  Everything  we  do  is motivated  by  some
                combination of conscious and unconscious needs or desires. Staying motivated is not something that happens
                naturally all the time. You should be ready to take challenges and open to positive learning. Remember that
                Impossible itself says ‘I am Possible’. For example, it’s only self-motivation that makes a good sportsperson.
                 • Self-Control:  It is the  ability to manage  your  impulse, emotions and  behaviour. Know  yourself so you can
                manage your emotions and impulses. It acts as a force to have a more successful and satisfying life. For example,
                Indian system of fasting is an excellent example of self-control. Fasting restricts a person from eating specific
                food.
                 • Self-Commitment: It is the state of being committed to yourself and being loyal to your actions. This is the first
                step to becoming conscious as you start looking at things in a more objective manner. Be who you are and stop
                fearing what others will think of you. For example, not eating junk food in any situation. Completing your school
                project on your own without any help.

                    52      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-IX]]></page><page Index="55"><![CDATA[• Problem Solving: It is an analytical skill that helps identifying a problem and finding a possible solution to
                   it. It requires a person to be creative and intuitive. You should be confident in your approach as you learn
                   which processes are most effective to overcome obstacles, which solutions may fail or could even create
                   additional problems. For example, A teacher has to find on her own how she can improve the performance
                   of her students.

                    • Positive Thinking: It is the optimistic approach to handle different situations in life. Rather than getting upset
                   and blaming others for terrible situations, positive thinking will control the situation with logical reasoning.
                   Remember that it’s your response that truly determines the outcome. For example, A student securing bad
                   marks will reason out with positive thinking that his efforts were not upto the mark.
                    • Stress Management: It is the technique to handle the levels of stress in day to day life by taking charge of your
                   emotions, efforts, thoughts and surroundings. We all have stress— at home and at work. No single method
                   works for everyone or in every situation, so experiment with different techniques and strategies. Focus on what
                   makes you feel calm and in control. Don’t let stress get in the way of your success. For example, Shifting to a
                   new house with things scattered all over brings a lot of stress.
                    • Time Management: It is the method of planning and balancing your time to meet your everyday targets. It
                   deals how effectively you utilise your time to achieve your goals. Staying organised can help you prioritise your
                   activities based on their urgency and importance. Focus on your abilities to complete your work in an effective
                   way. For example, Meeting the deadline of the project assigned in a class.
                    • Organisational Skills: It is the ability to plan and organise a given task in an effective manner. Good organisational
                   abilities will prevent difficulty in your work and disorder in your daily life. For example, A student needs to have
                   necessary material for the assigned activity, stay in their seat, and finish required work before going to the next
                   assignment.

                         Who am I?

                    • Criticism: When we are surrounded by people who have a negative attitude and constant criticism in the form
                   of verbal or behavioural criticism from them can harm self-esteem and confidence.
                   • Stress and Anxiety: Persistent stress or anxiety can undermine confidence and make it difficult to cope with challenges.

                 Physical
                 Physical factors will influence the personality of a person. It includes your:
                    • Body language

                    • Physical appearance
                    • Good health
                    • Personal hygiene and grooming
                    • Non-verbal signs and gestures
                                                                                     Self-Management Skills-I   57]]></page><page Index="60"><![CDATA[• Mood swings
                 • Speaking style and accent
              Good personal hygiene with a healthy physique boosts self confidence in a person. This will bring a positive mood
              and a great sense of happiness. People around you will treat you well. With this positive public image you will
              easily achieve your goals in life. For example:
                 • Wearing appropriate interview attire will help make the best first impression.
                 • A student with good oratory skills will always perform better in a class debate than a participant who is unexpressive.


              Social

              Social factors include our society and people around us. It can be the people in our classroom, family at home, friends
              in our colony, colleagues in our workplace, strangers on the street. Each one of us needs a push to start working
              harder, all of us want to be motivated by loved ones around us. The pressure of society has a very strong impact on the
              self-confidence of a person and will affect the performance of a person to a certain level. For example:

                 • Michael Jordan, the famous basketball player, was told in high school that he did not have the skill and felt
                dejected during his childhood.
                 • Dr. Seuss, the famous author of children’s literature, was rejected by nearly 27 publishers early in his career.


              Cultural

              Cultural impact is the behavioural characteristics of people based on their surroundings, religions, traditions, customs,
              and festivals. We need to be sensitive to people belonging to different backgrounds. It shapes how we see ourselves
              and others in our society. Also a family’s cultural values shape the development of a child. Young children may
              describe themselves based upon their family’s values. For example, some cultures do not allow women to step out of
              the house and earn a living. She is expected to be dependent on a male member. Children are expected to be sober
              and quiet in front of elders. While in other cultures all are treated equally and have full right to live the life they want.
              The influence of culture shapes a person and has a great impact on self-confidence. For example:
                 • A female speaker in a saree may not feel confident in a conference where all are dressed up in western formals.

                 • A student belonging to a tribal community will not feel confident in a class presentation in his boarding school.

                    •  Stay Clean and Hygienic: An individual’s personal hygiene is very important. It is one of the biggest reasons of

                  7.   How can you keep your thinking positive?
                Ans.  We can keep our thinking positive by following way:
                    •  Start your day with a positive gesture: One small positive thought in the morning can change your whole day.
                      Wake up every morning with the thought that something wonderful is about to happen. Every positive thought takes
                      you in the right direction
                    •  Manage time to relax: A tired body can be harmful to your productivity and health. Relaxed mind brings inner
                      strength, self confidence and positive thinking and that’s very important for your health.

                    •  Express gratitude: In our lives we do not realise that we receive a great deal more than we give. No one who
                      achieves success does so without the help of others. Be thankful for what you have, you’ll end up having more.

                  8.  What are the factors that affect self-confidence?                                         [NCERT]
                Ans.   The factors that affect self-confidence are given the following:
                    •  Social Factors: It is pre-evident that man is a social animal. We experience positivity and confidence when people
                      appreciate our effort and respect us. It can be understood simply that when a man is in a comfortable, friendly
                      environment, he forgets his weaknesses, flaws and incapabilities, rather he generates self confidence and starts
                      using  his  qualities  more  rationally  and  takes  more  interest  in  social  issues  too.  Hence,  social  factor  plays  an
                      important role in confidence building as he takes positive inputs from the society around him and gives back the
                      same.
                    •  Cultural Factors: In this scientific era, where technology has excelled so much, we Indians still haven’t forgotten our
                      culture, family values and ethics. Our traditional culture holds important position in our lives. Keeping or sticking to
                      cultural habits or traditional ethics, a strong value system or self recognition is felt in personality of a person and such
                      feeling gives more of self confidence.

              In the past few years, Information Technology (IT) has completely changed the ways we live. The Internet has
              become a convenient way to access the information. It has affected our both teaching and learning processes.
              Strong connectivity features has increased the usage of smartphones. The whole world has shrunk into this little
              device only through the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Let us now study in detail the
              role of ICT in our life and how we can enhance our ICT skills.


                       ICT

              Information Technology is  the use of hardware, software and networking technology for accessing, storing,
              retrieving and transmitting the information.

              Communication Technology is defined as exchange of information through networks using either wired or wireless
              media.
              So, if we combine these two important technologies in this digital world, then, it forms a new term called Information
              and Communication Technology which can be defined as use of hardware, software, networking to transmit, store,
              access and retrieve the information in the form of text, graphics, audio, video, multimedia in a digital platform.


              Role and Importance of ICT
              ICT is used in our personal, professional and daily life. Let us study about it in detail.

                    72      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-IX]]></page><page Index="75"><![CDATA[ICT at Home
                 If we see around us, technology is involved in our daily chores. Change in address required, applying for passport,
                 going for vacation—checking for weather conditions for packing, looking for best Indian platter for dinner— all
                 these can be achieved through technology.

                 Impacts of ICT in our personal life are:
                    • Education: Conventionally education was limited to one to one teaching methodology of students and teachers
                   in a classroom. Now with ICT, the classrooms have no geographical boundaries. You can enroll for a course from
                   New York University, while sitting in your study room in New Delhi. Most universities have started online degree
                   programs to reach a vast audience.
                    • Healthcare: ICT has played an important role in the field of healthcare. The Government creates awareness
                   and prevention methods of upcoming and ongoing diseases. Hospitals use electronic mediums to maintain the
                   medical records of their patients. Computer based machines are used for diagnosis purposes in the radiology
                   department. So much so AI is commonly used where we see robots performing operations on patients.

                    • Socialising: There were times when we used to maintain birthday calendars for our friends and family. ICT
                   brings this new way in the form of reminders which help you to send your greetings. You can get connected to
                   your school/college friends through different websites which are primarily made for socialising.

                    • Source of Information: In older days, the only source of information was books or our elders. Nowadays,
                   even after the consultation with the medical expert, we always tend to verify and gain more information on the
                   medication as well as on the diagnosis. It’s a source of information in every field.

                    • Shopping: Our shopping habits have changed because of the online medium. Instead of going to market, we
                   can receive everything at our doorstep with online shopping. It not only saves our effort of going out but also
                   provides us with options of reasonable prices.

                    • Communication: ICT helps us to communicate to our friends and relatives. There are more and more ways to
                   talk to people without meeting them. For example through emails, video conferencing, video calls, etc.

                    • Entertainment: Till now  television was  the  only way  of home entertainment.  The trend has changed
                   tremendously. Nowadays there’s a parallel entertainment industry that is producing entertainment programs
                   for online mediums. There are series and movies that are launched online only.


                 ICT at Workplace
                 With the inclusion of technology in our daily lives, our workplace is no longer our office. With the use of technology,
                 you will see there are many people who have started the concept of “Work from Home”. ICT in our professions can
                 be used in many ways:
                    • Maintenance of Records: There are software tools that are designed specifically to maintain employees’
                   records.  These  tools  have  the  capacity  to  maintain  intra  office  records  like  employee’s  leaves,  insurance,
                   tax, etc.
                    • E-Commerce: With the prevalence of e-commerce, businesses have a new channel for sales and services. It
                   has changed the way our society spends money. Buying and selling of products have become very convenient.
                    • Handling of Accounts: There are various tools available that facilitate the accounting jobs that are required
                   for business and personal purposes. You don’t need a professional to make a balance sheet or Profit and Loss
                   accounts. An individual can do it on his own with help of accounting tools easily available.
                    • E-Banking: Banking transactions do not always need going to bank. Banks are now available in an online mode.
                   So much so that new accounts can also be created in an online mode. Movement of money in an online mode
                   is always a catalyst to the developing economy of a country.

              Smartphones and tablets are essential  ICT tools  that have become increasingly popular in various aspects of

                 Tablets
                 A tablet is a mini computer with input, output and processing functions that are
                 all combined into one device which, can be operated via ‘touchscreen’. You can
                 perform various tasks just by touching the screen. It is bigger than a smartphone
                 and performs all the functions that can be done on a computer or a smartphone.
                 Difference between a smartphone and a tablet are:

                  Storage              Comes with different storage capacities.  Usually have higher storage capacity, i.e., they
                                                                            can store more images, videos, and apps
                                       Phones with higher storage are costly.


                 TV and Radio
                 TV and radio have been used as an ICT tool for both entertainment and to learn
                 new things. Radio is used to broadcast audio that includes news, songs, stories,
                 speeches, cricket commentary, etc., while TV is used to broadcast audio-visual
                 content to a wide audience. It is a powerful communication tool used for watching
                 movies, news, weather forecast, songs, cartoons and educational lectures etc.


                 Applications or Apps
                 Mobile applications, commonly referred to as "apps," are software applications designed to run on mobile devices
                 such as smartphones and tablets. These apps are developed for specific operating systems like iOS (Apple), Android
                 (Google), or sometimes both. Some of the apps are already present on the phone or tablet. These are called
                 “default” apps. Besides, there are hundreds of other apps that can be purchased and downloaded or downloaded
                 free of cost from online stores like Google Play Store for Android and Apple App Store for iOS.

                 Some of the default apps installed on all smartphones are:

              The home screen is the first (start) screen of a mobile device. There are three main parts of the home screen:
                 • Status Bar: It is the top part of the screen that displays icons like network signals, battery life, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth
                connectivity, 3G/4G status, etc.
                 • App Icons and Shortcuts: The central part of the screen is the main part with different App icons and shortcuts.
                These icons serve as shortcuts allowing users to launch their favourite apps with a simple tap. There can be
                several pages depending on the number of apps used.
                 • Dock: It is the lower part of the screen which contains apps that are always visible even if you change the page
                of the screen.

              Basic Gestures used with the Touch Screen of a Mobile

              Gestures are movements made with the finger to interact with the touchscreen of your mobile device. For example,
              to open an App, you tap on the touchscreen. Some of these commonly used gestures’ that can be used on the
              touchscreen are as follows:
                 • Tap: It is a quick touch or press on the screen that helps in selecting an item, opening
                an app, or activating a link.
                 • Tap and hold: This is similar to right-clicking your mouse, where you tap and hold
                your finger on the screen.
                 • Drag: To tap, hold, and move your finger across the screen.
                 • Swipe: Slide your finger to the right, left, up, or down on the screen, mimicking the
                action of turning a page.
                 • Double  tap: To tap twice quickly. This  will zoom out (increase the size  of) of
                something. For example, to make a word appear bigger.
                 • Pinch: Put your thumb and finger together on the screen and bring it closer to zoom in (reduce the size). For
                example, to make a picture appear smaller.

              Components of ICT

              There are six components of ICT:

                                             Data                                  People




                                                             Components
                                       Procedures               of ICT               Software





                                          Information                              Hardware


                 • Data: It is an individual unit that contains raw material given as input in ICT system. This data is interpreted to
                generate an information/processed data. For example, student marks of all subjects entered in a system.
                 • Procedures: These are methods used to pass  data and information to people involved in ICT system. For
                example, using code designed in any specific computer language to generate a report card.
                 • Information: It is the processed data or output/result generated in ICT system. For example, generating report
                card of marks entered as data.

                   information for the specific purpose. For example, marks entered by the teacher, report generated by staff of
                   computer department in a school.
                    • Software: These are programs and applications used in ICT system. These are available both as front end and
                   back end tools. For example, MS Word, MS Excel, and Visual Basic.
                    • Hardware: All physical components of the ICT system which we can touch and feel are called hardware. For
                   example, Input Devices (Mouse and Keyboard), Output Devices (Monitor and Printer), Processing Device (Central
                   Processing Unit) and Storage Devices (Hard Disk).


                         What is a Computer?

                 “Man is still the most extraordinary computer of all.”                                —John F. Kennedy
                 A computer is an electronic device that takes an input from the user, processes it in a desired way and generates an
                 output in a specific format. This processed data can also be stored in a storage device for future use. Computer as a
                 term is not a single unit. It is combination of two major components:
                    • Hardware: All the physical components of a computer which we can touch and see are called hardware. They
                   are visible parts of the computer. For example, keyboard, mouse, monitor, printer, motherboard, etc.
                   • Software: A set of instructions that we give to a computer to get the work done is called software. Let us take an example
                   of our mobile phone. The mobile that we buy is hardware and the applications that we install on it are software.
                   Software can be categorised in two types:
                      ✶ System Software: Software that is required to control the functions of a computer is called system software.
                     It refers to a program that works as a manager of the computer.
                      Without system software, we cannot use a computer. Some of the examples of system software are:
                     ○  Operating systems like Windows, DOS (Disk Operating System), Mobile OS, MAC OS, etc.
                     ○  Basic system utilities like disk formatters, file managers,etc.
                      ✶  Application Software: Software that is designed for a user and is made to do a specific kind of work is called
                     application software. Some of the examples of application software are:
                     ○  Microsoft Word and Open Office Writer are used for designing, editing and printing documents.
                     ○  Spreadsheet is used for creating data in a tabular form so that data calculation, analysis and graphical
                       representation can be done easily.

                 Basic Operations of a Computer
                 The computer performs four basic operations that are input, process, output, and storage. Let us discuss these in detail.


                 Input (Raw Data)
                 Input is the collection of raw facts or figures in the form of text, numbers, graphs, etc. provided to the computer
                 using input devices like keyboard, mouse, scanner etc. It is also called raw data or unprocessed data.

                 Process
                 Process is a method to convert raw data into meaningful information. The Central Processing Unit(CPU) of the
                 computer is responsible for processing of data.


                 Output (Information)
                 Output is the processed data. It is obtained after manipulation and processing of input (raw) data. It is also called
                 meaningful data or Information. Computer displays the output to the user through output devices like monitor,
                 printer, speakers, etc.

                                                                                                  ICT Skills-I  79]]></page><page Index="82"><![CDATA[Storage

              Storage is the process of storing either raw data or processed information. The data can be stored either using
              secondary storage devices like flash drive, hard disc, compact disc, or online storage medium like Google Drive,
              OneDrive, etc.

              Input-Process-Output Cycle

              All computing work revolves around three interrelated parts i.e., input, process, and output.
                 • An input is accepted by the user through the input devices.
                 • It is then processed by CPU and sent to the user as an output using output devices.
                 • There can be a need to store the output for later use in the storage devices.
                 • Sometimes the result generated acts as an input for the next stage of data flow.
                 • This flow of information follows a cycle which is known as the Input-Process-Output Cycle.

                                                   Input                    Output
                                       Data                    Process                 Information







                                                               Storage


              Characteristics of a Computer

              Following are some of the important characteristics of a computer:
                 • Speed: A computer can process data at a speed of millions of instructions per second. It is faster than human
                beings in doing complex tasks which can otherwise take a few days to process manually. It uses its internal clock
                to measure the processing speed for completing the job. The unit of computer speed is Hertz, which equals
                one cycle per second.
                 • Accuracy: The information provided by the computer is very accurate. Sometimes we may feel that we are not getting
                the desired result or maybe the output generated is not accurate. When we give wrong input to the computer, the
                system malfunctions or gives wrong output. It works on the principle of GIGO(Garbage In Garbage Out).
                 • Reliability: Information received using a computer is highly reliable. During an online flight reservation, seat
                allocated to one person cannot be reallocated to another at any cost. So, we can totally depend on the availability
                of information of seats during online booking or availability of stock during online shopping.
                 • Storage: Large volumes of data can be easily stored in a small space. Data can be preserved for a long time with
                least possibility of data tamper or data loss. There is no need to maintain a huge volume of manual registers and
                separate store room allocation to it.
                 • Versatile: Computer doesn’t mean a laptop or a personal computer. It can be a smartphone, tablet, online
                booking counter machine, ATM machine, X-ray machine in hospitals and GPS system in our cars. It is available in
                a variety of forms. So, we can say that it is highly versatile and has been designed to do any kind of job.


                       Input Devices


              The devices which help to give data or instructions to the computer are called input devices. The most commonly
              used are keyboard and mouse. Let us learn about some of the input devices.

                 A keyboard is probably the mostly used input device which can be either
                 wired or  wireless. It is used to accept  textual  data  from the  user.  It is
                 impossible to imagine a computer without one. A typical keyboard has a
                 typing area that includes the letters of the alphabet, numbers, punctuation
                 marks, and other basic keys similar to that of a type writer.                      Keyboard

                                    Mouse

                                    A mouse is another input device which is also known as a Pointing Device. As you move the
                                    mouse, the pointer on the screen moves. A typical mouse has two buttons and a wheel. It can
                                    be either wired or wireless.
                      Mouse

                 Scanner

                 A scanner is a device used to read the hand written notes, images, photos, and transfer
                 it in a digital form onto the computer where it can later be saved or manipulated as per
                 the requirement.
                                                                                                          Scanner

                                Light Pen
                                A light pen is a pointing device shaped like a pen and is connected to a VDU. The tip of the light
                                pen contains a light-sensitive element which, when placed against the screen, detects the light
                                from the screen enabling the computer to identify the location of the pen on the screen. We
                   Light Pen
                                generally use it to make a selection or draw anything on a screen.

                 Touchscreen
                 Touchscreen is the latest in the input devices where the input can be taken from the
                 user through a touch of a finger, stylus, or a light pen on a display screen. We can give
                 the entire set of commands by touching. Nowadays most of the laptops, Smart TV,
                 smartphones, tablets, etc. also have touch screens where the use of the keyboard is
                 minimised. It is a very useful and convenient alternative to a mouse or a keyboard in
                 a graphical user interface.                                                             Touchscreen

                                Microphone

                                Microphone is a device that converts the sound received into a digital audio form which can be
                                easily stored or manipulated in a computer.

                 Microphone

                 Barcode Reader
                 A bar code is a set of parallel lines that appear on the products as their identification.
                 You will find most of the packages having these barcodes that can be easily read by
                 barcode readers. Bar code readers work by placing a beam of light on the lines that
                 make up the bar code and detecting the amount of light that is reflected back. The
                 barcode read is then stored in the computer for preparing invoices.                    Barcode Reader

                                     MICR
                                     The bank account number and other details are printed onto bank cheques which are read
                                     by Magnetic Ink Character Recognition using a special magnetic ink. They are useful to
                                     find out whether the cheque is genuine or fake.

              A web camera or webcam is a type of video camera that saves images or visuals in realtime into
              a computer via USB, Ethernet or Wi-Fi.
              Web camera is used to create video links and helps us to set up authentic video conference
              stations. Some built-in webcams can be remotely activated from far-off locations. Webcams can
              also be used for security & surveillance purposes by monitoring the captured visuals.
                                                                                                          Web Camera
                       Processing Device—Central Processing Unit (CPU)

              After taking the input from the input devices, the information is sent for processing. The computer uses its brain
              to process the information. The computer’s brain is called the CPU or Central Processing Unit. CPU is basically
              divided into three parts:
                                       •  ALU stands for Arithmetic Logic Unit. It is responsible for all arithmetical and logical
                                       calculations.
                                       •  CU stands for Control Unit. It controls the flow of information in the system. The control
                                       unit is responsible for the flow of data from input devices to the processing unit and
                                       then to the output devices. It works like a traffic policeman who controls the traffic on
                                       the road.
                    CPU Chip           •  MU stands for Memory Unit. It is a storage unit that holds the processed or unprocessed data.


                       Output Devices

              An output device is a physical component that converts the processed data or information into a human readable format.

              Some of the commonly used output devices are:

              Monitor (Visual Display Unit)

              Monitor is a standard output device that is similar to a television screen. It is also
              known as Visual Display Unit (VDU) or console. An input from any input device such
              as a keyboard can be seen on the screen simultaneously. There are different types of
              monitors available in the market depending on the size and color.                          Monitor
              These days the most widely used monitors in computers, tablets, smartphones, Smart TV, etc. are LCD (Liquid Crystal
              Display). Its screen is made up of smaller elements called pixels. Resolution of any display unit is the number of
              horizontal and vertical pixels. A higher resolution provides a smoother, sharper, and clearer image.


              Printer
              A printer is an output device that is used to get the output on a physical medium like paper. The output on the
              screen is called a soft copy whereas the output from the printer is called a hard copy. It can be used to print both
              text and graphics. The two most common types of printers used these days are inkjet and laser printers.

                                             Inkjet Printer

                                             Inkjet printers are also called photo printers. They are used to print both in coloured
                                             or black & white format for home or small business purposes. The speed of an
                                             inkjet printer is measured by the number of Pages Per Minute (PPM). Mostly
                                             inkjet printers print from 12 to 36 pages per minute.

                 A laser printer  works just like a photocopy  machine that  prints the output  at
                 high-speed and good quality. It creates images using a laser beam and powdered
                 ink called toner. It is more expensive than inkjet printers and can be used for home
                 or business purposes.

                                                                                                       Laser Printer
                                                Plotter
                                                A plotter is an output device similar to a printer but used to print vector graphics
                                                like architectural designs, maps, computer aided drawings etc. by plotting lines
                                                using a pen. A printer uses a technology of joining closely spaced series of small
                                                dots  to  print  whereas  a  plotter  draws  using a  pen.  Multicolour  plotters use
                                                different-coloured pens to draw in different colours.

                 Speakers

                 Speakers are an output device that produce sound waves in the form of an output
                 which can be heard by a listener. Speakers can be attached to a computer or to
                 any other system like smartphones, tablets, Smart TV, etc. to enhance the volume
                 and the quality of audio output. The different kinds of speakers range from simple,
                 two-speaker output devices to surround-sound multi-channel units.                     Speakers


                                                Projector
                                                A projector  is a  display device  that  projects a  computer  screen  onto  a  flat
                                                surface, like a whiteboard or wall. It is most commonly used in home theaters or
                                                in organisations for official presentations.

                         Computer Memory

                 Computer memory holds raw data before it goes for processing and after processing it contains information which
                 can either be sent to output devices or stored in secondary storage devices for future use. There are two types of
                 memory in the computer— primary memory and secondary memory.


                 Primary Memory
                 This type of memory is necessary for a computer to work. It is also called the Internal Memory. This is the actual
                 place where the data is stored before it is taken to ALU for processing. Primary memory is of two types: RAM and
                 ROM.

                 RAM (Random Access Memory)

                 It is temporary in nature. The computer holds information in this memory and gets it
                 when needed. It remembers what you tell them and can even change to remember
                 new information. It is volatile in nature, which means that data will be erased when
                 the computer is turned off. That’s why you always save your work! RAM is considered
                 “random access”  because any part of it can be accessed randomly for reading or   Random Access Memory
                 writing of the data.

                                                                                                  ICT Skills-I  83]]></page><page Index="86"><![CDATA[ROM (Read Only Memory)

                                    It is permanent in nature. It is non-volatile which means its contents remain even after
                                    the computer is turned off. The information is coded at the time of manufacturing the
                                    computer. The computer needs this information for its basic functions.

                Read Only Memory

              Secondary Memory

              Secondary Memory provides extra storage where the data can be stored permanently for later use. It is also known
              as external memory as it can be stored anywhere. Examples of secondary memory are compact disc, hard disc,
              flash drive, etc.


              Hard Disk

              A Hard Disk  stores and provides quick access to large amounts of data  on an
              electromagnetically charged surface or set of surfaces. Hard disks are generally fitted
              inside the system unit. However, there are external hard disks also available. A hard disk is
              made-up of a collection of disks called platters stacked on a cylindrical rod. Each of which,
              like phonograph records, has data recorded electromagnetically in concentric circles or

                         Measuring Unit for Memory

                 The unit used to measure data stored in memory or storage devices is the byte. In computing, a byte for memory
                 is equivalent to a kilometer for distance, a second for time, or a kilogram for weight.

                 Computers work in binary digits— 0 and 1 to form endless combinations of 8 bits(1 Byte). This byte represents
                 a single letter, number, punctuation, or any other special character on the keyboard. These bytes combine in
                 different forms to represent data.

                    • Bit: A bit is the smallest measuring unit. It can be either 0(Off) or 1(On).
                    • Byte: A byte is the basic unit for measuring units. It is made up of 8 bits.

                 To represent huge data we have different units to measure as listed below:

                                               1 Byte                      8 Bits

                                               1 Kilobyte (KB)             1024 Bytes
                                               1 Megabyte (MB)             1024 KB

                                               1 Gigabyte (GB)             1024 MB
                                               1 Terabyte (TB)             1024 GB
                                               1 Petabyte (PB)             1024 TB

                         Peripheral Device Ports

                 These ports act as a connector or a point of attachment between the external peripheral devices like mouse,
                 printer, keyboard, camera, scanner, etc. and the computer. There are different types of ports present in a computer
                 system. Some of the commonly used are discussed below:
                    • Serial Port: In Serial port data transmission between the computer and the peripheral device takes place in a
                   sequence of one bit at a time. It was used to connect mouse and external modems in older times. Nowadays it
                   is replaced by a USB port.
                    • Parallel Port: In Parallel port data transmission between the computer and the peripheral device takes place in
                   a parallel line of eight bits at a time. It is used to connect scanners and printers.
                    • USB Port: Universal Serial Bus is a new technology port which supports the connection of a variety of devices
                   like scanners, printers, keyboard, cameras, speakers, etc. to the computer. It is much faster than serial or parallel
                   ports. Smartphones, Tablets, e-book readers use USB port for charging.
                    • Ethernet Port: Ethernet Port provides a network connection by connecting the ethernet cables to the computer
                   for network and Internet connectivity using wired technology.
                    • HDMI Port: High Definition Media Interface port is used to connect high quality audio and video devices like
                   MP3 players, cameras, smart phones, Tablets, Smart TV to computers. It helps in the transmission of good
                   quality audio and video files.
                    • Power Port: It is used to connect the system to the power supply.

                 • Power connector that gives power supply to all the essential components on the motherboard.


                       Understanding Operating System

              An Operating System is a system software which acts as an interface between the user and the computer. It is an
              important component of a computer system which controls all other components of the computer system. It helps
              us to communicate with the computer without knowing its language. Without an Operating System the computer
              is of no use. Some of the commonly used Operating Systems are Windows, DOS, UNIX, Ubuntu, MacOS etc.
              Mobile devices also have operating system that help them perform their functions. For example, Apple iOS and
              Google Android.

                         Booting

                 Booting is a process of starting the operating system and loading it in the computer’s memory when the power
                 is switched on. It is of two types:
                    • Cold Booting: After the computer is shut down completely followed by power off and then we switch it on to
                   start it, then, it is called cold booting.
                    • Warm Booting: It is when we press the Restart button without switching off the power supply and the computer
                   is reloaded with all its operating system files.

                         Procedure for Starting a Computer


                 When the power button is switched on, Windows 11 follows the given Start up Process:
                    • As soon as the power is on, ROM loads the BIOS instructions into the computer’s memory.
                    • It does Power On Self Test to check that all the hardware devices are functioning properly with constant supply
                   of the electricity. In case there is any error, a beep sound is produced, an error message is displayed on the
                   screen and the system stops loading windows.

                 Login and logout

                 The term "login" refers to the process of accessing and entering a user account to access the user's personalised
                 desktop environment. It involves  the steps necessary for providing the credentials details like username and
                 password etc. so that an authenticated person will gain access to the operating system. A login ID and password
                 is like a key to the lock which allows you to use the computer.
                 The login process is the initial step after starting or restarting a computer. The steps involved in login:

                 Step 1    Windows will display a sign-in screen where you can see a list of user accounts or enter your username/
                           email and password.
                 Step 2   Windows will verify your credentials against the information stored for the selected user account.
                 Step 3    Upon successful authentication, Windows will load your personalised desktop and launch background
                           processes.
                 Step 4   You are now logged in, and your user session begins.

                 Logging out is an essential step for security and privacy, as it ensures that unauthorised users cannot access your
                 account or data after you have finished your session. When you log out, you terminate your current user session,
                 and access to the system or application is restricted until you log in again.

                 The steps involved in logging out of Windows 11 will be:
                 Step 1    Click on the Start menu or press the Windows key on your keyboard.

                                                                                                  ICT Skills-I  89]]></page><page Index="92"><![CDATA[Step 2    Click on your profile icon or user account picture located at the top of the Start menu.

               Step 3    In the menu that appears, click on Sign out or Logout.

              The steps involved in Windows Boot Process are as follows:

               Step 1    Windows Loader will do an initial setup to load windows kernel into the computer’s memory (RAM).
               Step 2    After this, the Operating System will take over the whole process of controlling and configuring the system.
               Step 3    After the system configuration is done System Utilities and Antivirus will become active to participate
                        till the system is on.

               Step 4    Session Manager will take over and the system is ready for the authentication process to display the
                        user name and password screen.

               Step 5    If the valid username and password is entered, then, the Desktop is displayed and the computer is ready to use.

                 Taskbar


                 Taskbar is the thin strip present at the bottom of the screen. By default it is always visible at the bottom but we can
                 choose the auto hide option in the taskbar settings which will hide the taskbar. But it will reappear only when the
                 mouse cursor moves down to that area.

                         Files and Folders in Windows 11

                 File is defined as a program that stores the data organised in a specific format. It can be an executable (exe) file for
                 running a program, a Word document, a spreadsheet, an audio, a video or a program written in any programming
                 language. Each file in a computer has a unique name. This name is divided into two parts:
                    • Primary name: It can be any name given by using standard naming conventions. It can contain letters, numbers
                   and special characters.
                    • Secondary name or Extension: It tells us the category of the file and is automatically assigned by the program where
                   this file is created. For example, an audio file has an extension of .mp3, an Excel file has .xlsx, a Word file has .docx, etc.

                    • A folder is a directory created for storing the related files or subfolders under a specific name.

                                                                                                  ICT Skills-I  93]]></page><page Index="96"><![CDATA[Managing Files and Folders in Windows 11

              Windows 11 allows us to organise our files and folders in a well managed hierarchical structure using a special
              program called Windows Explorer. It displays all the disk drives, folders, subfolders, and files on our computer
              system. We use Windows Explorer to find, copy, delete, launch, and even configure programs and documents.

              The Windows Explorer displays the content in a hierarchical form divided into two sections:
                 • Left Section shows the directory tree, containing the list of folders and subfolders that we have on our system.
                On this side only folders and sub folders appear but no files such as Desktop, Documents, downloads, etc. appear.

                 • Right Section displays the content of the folder that we have opened on the left section. This section shows
                its subfolders and files. Depending on the type of view that we have activated, we will see different types of
                information regarding the files.

              There are three different ways to access File Explorer:

              Method 1:  Select the Windows File icon on the Taskbar.
              Method 2:  Right click on Start Menu and select Windows Explorer.

                         Mouse Operations in Windows 11


                 Mouse is an important input device in a graphical user environment like Windows where the user has to do simple
                 mouse clicks to get the job done. Windows 11 is designed to make the mouse easier to use. Let us now see how
                 useful this pointing device is in Windows 11.


                 Single-click                                                                          click

                 This is the most common task performed by a mouse in Windows 11. We can select
                 a program, file, folder, menu, sub-menu, option, etc. using a single left mouse click.
                 Whichever option is to be selected, move the mouse pointer to point to that area and
                 do a single left mouse click to select that option.

                     click
                   click

                                          Double-click
                                          When we use the left button to click twice in quick succession, then, it is called a
                                          double click. We generally use double click to open a file/folder, to open a specific
                                          program or application software.

                 To display context based pop-up menu or shortcut menu, we use the right mouse
                 button click. For example right clicking on a cell in a spreadsheet gives you important

                       Shutting down the Computer

              After we are done with our work and we are in no need to use a computer, then, it is always advisable to do proper
              shutdown of the system. Shutting down a computer means sending all the operating system files back to the hard
              disk and saving all the work into a proper secondary storage device followed by switching off the power supply to
              all the important components of the computer.

              The steps to shut down a computer are:

               Step 1   Click on Start button. The Start menu appears.

               Step 2   Select the Power button in the bottom-right corner.

               Step 3   Select Shut down option.

                    • Control keys: These keys such as Control (CTRL), SHIFT, SPACEBAR, ALT, CAPS LOCK and TAB are used in
                   combination with other keys to perform specific functions related to the operating system or software applications.
                    • Enter key: The Enter key, also known as the Return key, is a fundamental key on a computer keyboard. Its
                   primary purpose is to execute a command or to move the cursor to the next line in a text document.
                    • Punctuation keys: Punctuation keys include keys for punctuation marks, such as colon (:), semicolon (;), question
                   mark (?), single quotation marks (‘’), and double quotation marks (“”) are essential for proper grammar, syntax,
                   and communication in written language.
                    • Navigation keys: These keys allow you to move the cursor or navigate through text and documents. They are
                   essential for editing, selecting, and moving within different software applications. Arrow Keys (Up, Down, Left,
                   Right) allow you to move the cursor or highlight text in the corresponding direction.

                   The Home key moves the cursor to the beginning of a line of text or to the start of a document. The End key
                   moves the cursor to the end of a line of text or to the end of a document. The Page Up key scrolls up one page
                   at a time in a document or on a webpage. The Page Down key scrolls down one page at a time in a document
                   or on a webpage.
                    • Command keys: Command Keys, such as INSERT (INS), DELETE (DEL),  and BACKSPACE execute specific
                   commands or functions within an application or the operating system. When the INSERT key is turned ON, it
                   helps you overwrite characters to the right of the cursor. The DELETE key and the BACKSPACE key are used to
                   remove typed text, characters and other objects on the right and left side of the cursor, respectively.
                    • Windows key: It is often denoted by the Windows logo (  ), and is found on most Windows-compatible
                   keyboards. Pressing this key opens the Start menu.

              Nowadays,  the  Internet  has become  an  important  means  of  communication for  the  people  even  at  remote
              locations. It is a worldwide system of interconnecting computers through a global network for the purpose of
              sharing information. It can be accessed by anybody all over the world.

              It is defined as: "A global system of networks using wired or wireless mediums to interconnect different types
              of networks consisting of billions  of computers, smartphones and  other  smart devices for  sharing data  and
              information with add-on features of entertainment, services and ecommerce."

              If your computer is connected to the Internet, you say that your computer is online. With the help of the Internet,
              you can gather a lot of knowledge which is available on it. The knowledge is stored in a big library/ storehouse,
              called the World Wide Web (WWW) or the Web. It is a collection of different websites that you can view if you are
              connected to the Internet. You can also use these websites to buy something, watch movies, read books, learn new
              skills, educate yourself, find the best colleges to study further, etc. Uses of the Internet There is no limit to what
              you can do online, but some of the most common uses are given below:

                 • Search information: The Internet helps to locate information from the world wide web using search engines.
                These are websites that allow the users to search for any information using keywords or phrases. You can get
                the latest information about anything that is uploaded on the web, whether it is the result, news about an
                earthquake, a cricket match or the election details.
                 • Shopping: You can buy and sell products, such as books and electronic goods over the Internet. You can also
                pay for these products via digital modes of payments, such as wallets, plastic cardsor through e-banking.
                 • Entertainment: The online mode has become a new generation entertainment medium. You can watch movies/
                series online, play games, listen to music, etc. There are online applications that allow you to even play musical
                instruments online. You can play games in teams with other people on this virtual platform.
                 • Online booking: You can book movie tickets, hotels, bus/train/ plane tickets, etc., online.
                 • E-mail and chatting: You can talk or send messages to people all around the world quickly and easily. The
                messages you send over the Internet can reach any part of world in just a few seconds. For example, Gmail and
                Outlook.
                 • Online learning: There are a number of courses available online-some are free while others are not. You can do
                a course on a topic you like or want to know more about.
                 • Social networking: You can share your interests, knowledge and stories with your family and friends around the
                world. For example, Facebook and Twitter.
                 • Online banking: You can do banking operations, like checking details of your bank account or transferring
                money from one account to another through mobile banking/NEFT/RTGS.


              Connecting to the Internet
              To connect to the Internet, you need:
                 • A device, such as a computer, laptop or mobile.
                 •  A connection device, i.e., a modem. An Internet Service Provider (ISP)—i.e., the telephone company which
                provides the Internet connectivity using the phone lines or a wireless network.


              Types of connections
                 • Wired connections: When our computer is connected to the Internet using a wire, it is called a wired connection.
                We use Ethernet cables (cables used for connecting to the Internet) to connect to the modem which connects
                to the ISP using a phone line.

                 Bandwidth
                 Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be transmitted over a network in a certain amount of time. To understand
                 Let us take the example of a pipe, the amount of water flowing through a pipe depends on its thickness. Similarly,
                 the amount of data that your network can receive or send depends on its bandwidth. In case of digital devices,
                 the bandwidth is usually expressed in bits per second (bps) or bytes per second and in case of analog devices, the
                 bandwidth is expressed in cycles per second, or Hertz (Hz).

                 Data transfer speed over the networks (including the internet) is calculated in terms of bits per second.
                   1 Kbps (kilo bits per second)    = 1000 bits per second
                   1 Mbps (mega bits per second)  = 1000 kilo bits per second

                   1 Gbps (giga bits per second)   = 1000 mega bits per second


                 World Wide Web
                 The World Wide Web (WWW) or simply the Web is a huge collection of information. It is a vast network of linked
                 hypertext files, stored on computers throughout the world, that can provide a computer user with information
                 on a huge variety of subjects. Thus, it serves as a platform through which users can use or share information. It is
                 made up of
                    • A web page
                    • A web browser
                    • A system to transfer information between the web browser and the web pages


                 Web page
                 A web page is a document present on a computer that is connected to the Internet. There are hundreds of web
                 pages. Each web page has a unique address/location like the address of a house. We can use the address to see a
                 particular web page. To view a web page you need a web browser on your computer.


                 Web browser

                 A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for using and sharing information on
                 the World Wide Web. The most popular web browsers that are used today are







                                    Chrome      Firefox      Opera      Safari         Microsoft Edge
                                                                                                  ICT Skills-I  101]]></page><page Index="104"><![CDATA[Searching for information

              Do the steps below to search for information on the Internet.

               Step 1   Open an Internet browser.
               Step 2   Type the topic, on which you want information, in the search box and hit the Enter key.

               Step 3   The search results having the required information will be displayed.


              Protocols

              Protocols are a set of rules and standards that define how data is exchanged and transmitted over a network.
              They establish guidelines that enable devices and systems to communicate effectively with each other. Protocols
              govern various aspects of communication, including the format of data packets, error handling, authentication,
              and encryption.
              Some of the important protocols are discussed below:

                 • SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): SMTP is a protocol used for sending and receiving email. It handles
                the transmission of emails between servers and is responsible for the reliable and efficient delivery of emails
                over the Internet.

                 • TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol): TCP/IP is the foundational protocol suite of the
                Internet. It consists of two main protocols, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol). TCP
                ensures reliable delivery of data packets between devices on a network by establishing a connection-oriented
                session and managing packet sequencing and acknowledgment. It is a unique logical address of a device that
                helps identify a device at the time of sending and receiving data in a Network. It is made up of numbers or
                characters. Remembering these numeric values to access a specific website is a difficult task, so these numbers
                are given sensible textual names called web addresses.
                 • FTP (File Transfer Protocol): FTP is a standard network protocol used for transferring files between a client and
                a server on a computer network. It provides a simple way to upload and download files from one computer to
                another over the Internet.

                 • HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure): HTTPS is an extension of HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
                that adds a layer of security using SSL/TLS encryption. It ensures that data transmitted between a web browser
                and a web server remains private and integral. HTTPS is commonly used for secure communication over the
                Internet, particularly for sensitive transactions such as online banking, e-commerce, and accessing confidential
                information.

              These protocols play  critical roles in facilitating  different  types  of communication and  data  transfer  over  the
              Internet, each addressing specific needs related to email transmission, network communication, file sharing, and
              secure web browsing.


                       Terminologies of the Internet

              Some of the important terms related to the Internet are:

                 • Online: Going online means connecting your device to the Internet.
                 • Hyperlink/HyperText/Link: When a move pointer hovers over a word, text or graphics, it changes to a small
                hand and when clicked it opens a webpage or a website. It serves as a link for connecting many web documents
                to simplify the process of web browsing.

                   structures content using tags and elements, defining the layout and appearance of web pages in conjunction
                   with CSS and JavaScript.
                    • Website: Collection of related web pages that can be accessed by a unique web address or URL. A website is
                   owned either by an individual or any organisation and can be hosted on a World Wide Web.

                    • Homepage: The first page displayed when you visit a website is called a homepage. It generally contains the
                   hyperlinks for the other webpages.
                    • ISP (Internet Service Provider): An ISP is a company that provides individuals and organisations access to the
                   internet. ISPs offer various services such as internet access, domain registration, web hosting, and email services.

                    •  Web address/URL (Uniform Resource Locator): It is the address of the web file located on a web server that
                   can be accessed using any web browser on the Internet. It is similar to the address we write on an envelope. URL is
                   translated into a numeric address using the domain name system. For example: https://www.orangeeducation.in/
                    • Cookies: Cookies are small pieces of data stored on a user's device by websites they visit. They are used to
                   remember information about the user, such as login status, preferences, and tracking information for personalised
                   experiences and analytics.

                    • DNS (Domain Name System): It is a phonebook of the Internet that translates each URL into its corresponding
                   IP address. Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address. Since it is difficult to memorise IP
                   addresses, so for convenience the alphanumeric address is used for naming the websites. When we type the
                   alphanumeric address in the address bar of the web browser, then, the DNS translates it into an IP address and
                   requests the web server to locate the specified file on its site.

                 Some common Top-Level Domains are as follows:

                    • Postal mail is the traditional way of sending physical mail which takes a few days to deliver. Email is the fastest
                   way to send digital messages all across the world within a fraction of seconds.
                    • Postal mail is chargeable and the cost increases with the distance and the weight. If you are planning to send
                   some magazines, brochures, photo album, then, the cost will increase. In Email, we pay only for the Internet
                   with no extra cost of the email services. So, it is the cheapest way to send mail with bulky content. You can send
                   photos, audios, videos, animation, documents, etc. as an attachment easily.
                    • In postal mail, if you have to send the same letter to multiple recipients, then, it is an expensive process.
                   Through email we can send the same mail to multiple recipients by just writing the email address in cc or bcc with
                   no added cost.
                    • In postal mail, the recipient can receive a mail only at the marked geographical location using street number, locality,
                   city, pincode, etc. In email, it is a logical address that can be accessed from any computer and at any location all over
                   the world.


                 Advantages of Email
                 The following are the advantages of using email:
                    • Sending and receiving emails is a fast way of communicating as compared to the traditional mails.
                    • Emails can be sent anytime. That means it’s not restricted to only working days or working hours.

              Structure of an Email Message

              Following are the major sections of an email message:
                 • Header: This section allows you to enter the following information:
                    ✶ From: Email address of the sender.

                    ✶ To: email address of the recipient.
                    ✶ Cc (Carbon Copy): This option is generally used when we want the same message to be sent to a large
                   group of people at the same time. The list of all the recipients will be displayed in the received message
                   header. We can also use this option when we want another person to be informed of the mail sent to the
                   recipient.
                    ✶ Bcc (Blind Carbon Copy): This Email address is invisible to a recipient. This option is used when you want to
                   send a copy of an email to another person without bringing it to the knowledge of the recipient. It will not be
                   displayed in the received message header.
                    ✶ Subject: It is the brief discussion of the topic of the message.
                 • Body: The main content of the email, written by the sender, is in the body. It consists of the message and the
                signature of the sender.
                 • Attachments: We can attach any type of file like word document, presentation, any program code, audio, video
                etc. It is usually a symbol of a paper pin. Select this option to open a dialog box which gives access to files stored
                in your device. Select a proper path to attach the required file.
                 • Date: It is the date and time of sending a message.

              After climbing up the ladder of your education, you need to focus on your inner strengths and find out what are
              the real long-term plans of your life. You may have to decide whether you should go for a job with a fixed salary
              that you will be getting every month or you should go for business. If you decide to do business, then you might
              have to further decide whether doing a family business will be a good option for you or you want to try your luck
              and skills in your own startup. Both paths have their own advantages and disadvantages. This chapter is all about

              be small-scale, owned by a person or its family members, with profits or losses shared among them. Examples
              of small businesses include selling flowers grown on their own farms, operating eateries or cafes in local markets,
              and selling ready-made garments locally. Another category can be a large-scale business with its chains all over
              the country or across the world, with its profits shared amongst the owners and its employees. For example, pizza
              food chain, ready-made apparels chain etc.

                    • Manufacturing: This kind of business uses raw materials, labour, technology, capital and other resources for
                   the production of finished goods. It follows a step-by-step approach of putting together raw materials, parts
                   and components, moving from one workstation to the other with the help of technology, machinery, robots,
                   computers, and labour.
                    Finished goods are sold to the wholesalers, who in turn sell them to retailers. The consumers generally purchase
                   these finished goods from the retailers. Some of the examples of manufacturing businesses are that of food,
                   beverages, apparels, furniture, mobile phones, laptops, cosmetics and many more.

              merchandising or all of these. It does business in the form of goods and services. For example, a restaurant is
              in manufacturing by preparing a ready to eat food in the form of fine dining. At the same time, it works as a
              merchandiser by selling beverages with the fine meals. It also provides services by serving home deliveries through

                 The word “Entrepreneur”  is  derived  from  the  French  verb  ‘entreprendre’  which  means  "to  undertake".  An
                 Entrepreneur is a person who invests his time, energy and money to initiate an exclusive idea for a new venture. He
                 starts his own start-up with the desire to establish it. He may earn profits or bear losses and is wholly responsible
                 for the unpredictable failures and risks.
                 They are the innovators of the market who see opportunities where others see roadblocks. The success of these
                 business innovators is undoubtedly essential to change our economy for the advancement of our societies.

                 Entrepreneurship is the act of executing an innovative idea in a business. The output of this innovative process of
                 setting up a business is called an enterprise.


                                Entrepreneur                  Entrepreneurship                 Enterprise

                                   Person                         Process                       Outcome
                 Let's take an example:

                 Go Green Company is a successful entrepreneur project where a group of 5 college students decides to give plants
                 in their locality at cheaper price to support the Green Economy. In a year they got a wonderful response, so they
                 decided to open up their own nursery and supply plants in the whole city.
                 So in this example:
                 Group of college students is an Entrepreneur.

                 Innovative ways of running their own business is Entrepreneurship.
                 The output of this innovative process is Go Green Company, which is the Enterprise.

                         What is Entrepreneurship?


                 Entrepreneurship is setting your own business in an innovative manner which may have great risks and desires to
                 earn more profits. Entrepreneurship, thus involves taking risks with innovation, planning and decisions so as to
                 increase productivity in any field business, agriculture, social work, education, etc. It thus plays an important role
                 in the process of economic development. Entrepreneurship can be at small scale, medium scale or large scale in
                 terms of products and services. There are four main elements of entrepreneurship:
                    • Innovation: It means doing something in a creative and different way. This is the key element of entrepreneurship.
                   Opening a roadside restaurant is just like opening a business but bringing the element of "Home cooked food
                   for the people in a Food Truck" is called an innovation in business.
                    • Organisation: This plays an important role if a startup is launched at a large scale with a big investment. Though
                   an entrepreneur is a person leading the whole business with his ideas but the other employees working in an
                   organisation are equally important for the success of the startup.
                    • Risk bearing: Doing a business with a new idea is always associated with risk. But taking a calculated risk is
                   an important element of entrepreneurship. This will bring change in the society by bringing new products and
                   services.
                    • Perception: Entrepreneurship should have a strong perception of running a business in an innovative manner.
                   An entrepreneur should implement his plans and ideas in such a way that helps him achieve long term goals of
                   his business with greater profits.

              In a bustling city where time seemed to move faster than anywhere else, there lived a young man named Shashank.
              He had always been fascinated by technology and its potential to solve everyday problems. He worked long hours
              at a tech startup, but his mind constantly churned with ideas of his own.

              One rainy evening, while waiting for a delayed train, he noticed a group of commuters struggling with their wet
              umbrellas as they entered the station. It was a familiar sight—dripping umbrellas left on floors, benches, and even
              against walls, causing slippery hazards. Recognizing this inconvenience, an idea sparked in his mind.
              Over the next few weeks, he sketched designs during lunch breaks and late nights, envisioning a solution—a
              collapsible umbrella stand that could be easily installed in public spaces. It would provide a designated spot for
              umbrellas, minimizing clutter and enhancing safety. Excited by his concept, he shared his idea with a few trusted
              friends and colleagues who encouraged him to pursue it.

              With  determination,  he  refined  his  design,  sourced  materials,  and  meticulously  crafted  a  prototype  in  his  small
              apartment. Armed with a functional model, he approached local businesses and transportation hubs, pitching his
              innovative umbrella stand. Initially met with skepticism, He persevered, demonstrating the practicality and benefits
              of his invention.
              Slowly but steadily, interest grew. Cafes, offices, and train stations began to install Shashank's umbrella stands,
              impressed by their simplicity and effectiveness. Word spread quickly among commuters and business owners alike,
              and soon, orders poured in from across the city. He found himself managing production, logistics, and customer
              inquiries, all while juggling his day job.
              As demand soared, he made the leap to focus full-time on his venture. With support from investors who believed
              in his vision, he scaled up production, expanded his product line, and even developed an app to track umbrella
              stand locations and availability in real-time. His business, named "DriStop Solutions," became a staple in cities
              prone to rain, celebrated for its practicality and contribution to urban safety.

              Years later, as he looked out from the rooftop of his thriving office, he couldn't help but marvel at how a simple
              observation on a rainy day had transformed into a successful enterprise. What began as a solution to a common
              inconvenience had grown into a testament to his passion for innovation and problem-solving.
              Reflecting on his journey, he realised that recognising a need, seizing an opportunity, and nurturing an idea had
              been the pillars of his success. With a smile, he knew that his entrepreneurial spirit had not only made a difference
              in people's lives but also inspired others to see challenges as opportunities waiting to be solved.

                         Some Important Terms in Entrepreneurship


                 Entrepreneurs take risks to make a profit. Let us now try to understand the meaning of the word profit and risk
                 used frequently in entrepreneurship:
                    • Profit: The term "profit" refers to the financial gain that an entrepreneur gets or a positive difference between total
                   income earned and total costs invested in running a business. Profit is the main indicator of a business's financial
                   success or failure. For example, Nisha has recently started running her own flower shop. She made her quarterly
                   report and found that her income is little more than her total expense. This brought confidence in her and she
                   planned to keep a close watch to bring up the profit margins for future growth of her business.

                    • Risk: The term "risk" refers to a situation where the result is not known and could lead to a loss. Entrepreneurs
                   often face a variety of risks as they initiate, develop, and operate their business. Understanding and managing
                   risks are essential components of successful entrepreneurship. These risks can sometimes bring failures also
                   in a business. For example, in the above situation where Nisha, a florist, has established her business well in a
                   span of one year. She now wants to expand her business by opening another branch in a nearby city where the
                   competition is very high and the cost of investment is also more but she is quiet confident and wants to take
                   the risk because she feels risk is an integral part of entrepreneurship, and successful entrepreneurs understand
                   the importance of identifying, assessing, and managing risks effectively.
                    • Wage Employment: It exists as a partnership between two entities : the employer and the employee. In this
                   type of employment, an employee receives compensation for their work in the form of wages or salary. It does
                   not involve risks and the amount paid is fixed with certain incentives irrespective whether an employer is having
                   loss or profit in his business. The continuity of the service in case of wage employment depends on the terms
                   and conditions laid down in the contract between the two parties, as well as the relationship between the
                   employer and the employee.

              society.
              Entrepreneurial  Development  Programs  have  been  designed  and  supported  by  the  government  of  almost  all
              countries to develop entrepreneurial abilities among the interested people. These programs help them to identify,
              develop, polish and strengthen their entrepreneurial skills so that they play their entrepreneurship role effectively
              and become a successful entrepreneur.


                       Steps For Starting a Business

              Starting a business involves planning, making financial decisions, doing market research, and acquiring knowledge
              in areas you never thought you would learn about before. If you are planning to start your own business, then you
              should follow certain steps:

               Step 1    Plan and finalise a business idea: This is a very important step where you make a choice of starting
                        your own business with your planned idea. This could be:
                        •  Something you are interested in.

                        •  Something related to your skilled learning.
                        •  Something that the market requires.
               Step 2    Plan and finalise your finances: Before you implement your business idea, you need to have a clear
                        picture of your financial status. You need to figure out how much money you'll need to start your
                        business and let it survive for at least a year without profits. The money you are planning to invest in
                        business will be:
                        •  Taken from your savings and personal assets.
                        •  Borrowed from banks or any other financial company.
                        •  Utilised from the profit of some other business.
               Step 3    Choose your legal business structure: Here, you decide whether you want to be a sole proprietor, or
                        if you wish to start a business in a partnership, or you plan to start a Limited Liability Company. After
                        this, you finalise aspects like business name, tax details, employee details, etc.

               Step 4    Finalise the business location: Here, you finalise your business location based on the location of your
                        target market, business partners and your personal preferences. You plan to buy, rent, or build the
                        prime location. Factors like access to talents, network opportunities, business and investor friendliness,
                        low taxes, etc. play an important role in this.

               Step 5    Build your team: Depending on the size of the business, the team needs to be built. Job roles to be
                        assigned, number of full time and part time employees required, different departments to be created,
                        etc. are the factors to be taken into account while building a team.

                           support services, etc., you can reach your customers. Through them you have a fair picture of your
                           customers' likes and dislikes and your improvement areas.
                 Step 7    Promote the business: This helps you to bring your business straight to potential customers. It can
                           be done through advertisements on TVs, radios, newspapers, social media, etc. If it is a small scale
                           business, then promotion is done through pamphlets in newspapers.

                 Step 8    Feedback in the long run: It is important to take feedback from the customers in the long run. You can
                           use the feedback to improve your product and reach out to a larger group for future expansion of the
                           business.


                         Characteristics of Entrepreneur


                 Let us now look at some of the distinguishing characteristics of entrepreneurship.
                    • Ability to take up risks.
                    • Believe in hard work and discipline.
                    • Adaptable and flexible to achieve the goals of enhancing quality and customer satisfaction.
                    • Knowledge of the product and services and their need or demand in the market.

                    • Financial literacy and money management skill.
                    • Effective planning, communication skills and execution.


                         Qualities of an Entrepreneur

                 A person who does not take risks, is not open to new ideas and is running the business only to earn a steady
                 source of income is not an entrepreneur. An entrepreneur needs to have the following set of qualities to make his
                 business grow:
                    • Patience: Entrepreneurship often involves facing challenges and uncertainties. Patience is essential to handle
                   difficult times and waiting for the efforts to be paid, especially at the time of dealing with setbacks. It allows
                   entrepreneurs to maintain a long-term perspective and make strategic decisions.
                    • Positivity: A positive mindset is essential in overcoming obstacles and setbacks. It helps entrepreneurs to stay
                   focused on solutions rather than problems even when he/she takes a big risk.


                    • Hardworking, Never  Giving Up and Perseverance: Hard work is the
                   foundation for building and sustaining a successful business. Entrepreneurs
                   should never give up in attaining their goals, even at the time of failures. It
                   is important to learn from setbacks and keep on moving towards their goals.


                    • Confidence: Confidence plays a crucial role in making decisions, taking risks, and leading a team. Entrepreneurs
                   need  to believe in their  abilities and  vision to inspire trust  in others, including employees, investors, and
                   customers. Confidence brings vision and helps them navigate through uncertainty.
                    • Open to Trial and Error: Entrepreneurs need to be open to new ideas and try them without fear of failure. Being
                   open to trial and error allows entrepreneurs to adapt their strategies, refine their approach, and discover what
                   works best for their business.

                 innovation. Entrepreneurs must have a creative mindset so that they
                 can identify new opportunities, solve problems, and differentiate their
                 products or services in the market. This will help their businesses stay
                 competitive and adapt to changing environments.


                       Role of an Entrepreneurship


              Entrepreneurship plays a crucial role in both social and economic development, contributing  to job creation,
              innovation, and the overall well-being of communities. Countries which encourage entrepreneurship have grown
              fast.
              Let us discuss the social and economic role of an entrepreneurship in detail:

                 • Economic Development—Money in Circulation: An entrepreneur provides better and cheaper products and
                 services for customers that brings economic growth. As entrepreneurs grow their business, investors put money
                 into their businesses and expect good returns. As more and more entrepreneurs create business opportunities,
                 the economy grows.

                 • Social Development—Creation of Jobs: An entrepreneur starts their business initially on a small scale. If the
                 business shows some profits and grows over time, then an entrepreneur needs to expand operations, creating
                 more jobs. Good quality jobs enable more people to earn money and have a good life.

                 •  Improved Standard of Living—More things available to live a comfortable life: When an entrepreneur is
                 involved in selling goods like automobiles, furnitures, real estates, mobile phones and mobile service then it
                 helps people to live a more comfortable life.

                 • Optimal Use of Resources: Entrepreneurs contribute a lot in different ways in exploring both renewable and
                 non-renewable natural resources present around us so that these natural resources can be used in optimal ways
                 that reduces costs and increases their profits.

                 • More Benefits at Lower Prices Products and Services at Competitive Prices: Entrepreneurship plays a crucial
                 role in providing more benefits at lower and competitive prices by driving market competition, increasing
                 innovation, and keeping costs low, ultimately benefiting consumers and contributing to economic growth and
                 development.


              Benefits of Entrepreneurship

              The various benefits of entrepreneurship include the following:
                 • Do what you are interested in: Entrepreneurship helps the entrepreneurs to pursue their passions and interests,
                 allowing for greater creativity and innovation in their work.
                 • Work for yourself, and not for others: Entrepreneurship provides the freedom to design work hours, select
                 projects, and work from any place. Entrepreneurs can decide the kind of work they would like to do and how
                 they want to do it.
                 • Make profits for yourself: As an entrepreneur, one can decide how much money they want to earn and
                 how much they want to invest in the business. They decide on the salary, wages and incentives of the
                 employees.

                   courageous and ready to take risks. Taking risks can lead to greater financial success, as it allows entrepreneurs
                   access to more resources.


                         Difference between Businessman and Entrepreneur

                 It is generally assumed that an entrepreneur and a businessman are the same people but both of them have a
                 different approach for their business. A businessman uses traditional ways of doing business but an entrepreneur
                 goes for innovative ways of doing a business.

              All aspects of our lives are impacted by the environment we live in, and our daily actions have an impact on the
              environment as well. Cities are dependent on nearby villages for their food supply, and these communities in
              turn depend on woods, meadows, rivers, and seashores for resources like water, fuel wood, fodder, etc. These
              resources,  derived  from the  interconnected  web  of  life formed by  plants  and  animals, sustain our  existence.
              Similarly, our  school environment is composed of both  physical and  sociocultural dimensions.  The physical
              environment encompasses the school building, classrooms, library, laboratories, corridors, kitchen, toilets, garden,
              and playground—a backdrop essential to our educational pursuits and daily routines. In parallel, the sociocultural
              environment within our school is shaped by various factors. It includes the quality of teaching and learning climate
              established by educators, the diversity of student activities, inclusivity  and respect for diversity, enriches our
              learning experience and community dynamics. These elements together create a supportive environment where
              learning thrives and students grow.
              A balance in the environment is essential for the existence of a healthy life on this earth. Humans constantly interact
              with it in direct or indirect ways. Sometimes this interaction is biased and disturbs the balance of this mother earth,
              resulting in changes that affect all. We all need to understand its importance and work in the direction of saving
              it from all possible ways of destruction. In this chapter, we will learn some important facts about our environment
              and its relationship with society.


                       Ecosystem

              An ecosystem is defined as a community where living and non-living things interact with each other and their
              surrounding environment to form a balanced system. Any imbalance in any of the components will disturb the
              whole ecosystem, which might create problems in the existence of other living organisms.

              It is made up of two important components:
                 • Biotic: It refers to living organisms of the ecosystem which can be plants and animals. Plants are considered
                to be autotrophs which make their own food by trapping energy of the sun. This energy flows through all the
                other living components when plants are consumed by plant eating animals which inturn are eaten up by other
                bigger animals.

                   sunlight, temperature, nutrients, etc.
                 There are two main types of ecosystem:
                    • Terrestrial: A terrestrial ecosystem is a community of living and non-living things on land. They live, develop
                   and interact with each other in soil and air around them. It includes forest, grassland, desert, etc.
                    • Aquatic: An aquatic ecosystem is a community of living and non-living things in water. They live, develop and
                   interact with each other in water around them. It includes marine and freshwater ecosystems.


                         Environment

                 'Environment' word is derived from the French word 'Environia' which means “to surround”. In simple terms, it refers
                 to our surroundings, consisting of physical, chemical, and biological elements that maintain a balance between the
                 living and non-living components. It also impacts the growth and development of any life in the surrounding area.
                 Our environment is classified into two basic categories:


                 Natural Environment

                 When all living and non-living elements occur naturally in our surroundings and affect life in its natural ways by
                 encompassing interaction of all living species and natural resources, it forms our natural environment. Plants and
                 animals living on land, in air, or water form our natural environment. It may be claimed as Abiotic and Biotic.


                 Man-Made Environment

                 It is the environment created by humans to create an atmosphere comfortable for him to interact and adjust to
                 the natural environment. For example, permanent human settlements like villages, towns, cities, transport and
                 communication facilities, factories, dams, etc.

                         Relationship Between Society and Environment

                 A group of people living together to form a tribe, village, or a city sharing common interests, and having constant
                 social interactions forms a society. The people living in society need to interact with the environment to obtain their
                 food, water, fuel, and many other things. They sometimes exploit the natural resources present in the environment
                 for their own benefits, thus causing pollution and environmental damage. For example, humans have been cutting
                 down forests to clear land to grow crops for centuries, and due to this deforestation there is a change in the
                 climatic conditions.

                 Humans interact with the environment in two different ways:
                    • By utilising natural resources such as land, plants, water, soil, minerals, food in terms of plants and animals.
                    • By modifying the environment through various activities such as industrialisation, deforestation, mining, building
                   dams, etc.



                              Brainy Fact

                       The  Constitution  of  India  contains  specific  provisions  for  the  protection  and  improvement  of
                       environmental quality. Article 48-A of the Constitution says that "the state shall endeavour to

              The resources that exist without any intervention of humans and are present in abundance in our surroundings
              are called natural resources. These are air, water, land, plants, trees, sunlight, etc. Living organisms are dependent
              on these resources for their existence. The resources which are developed by human beings during the growth of
              civilisation are called artificial resources. For example, biogas, thermal efficiency, plastics etc. There are four types
              of natural resources:

                                                             Natural Resources









                         Renewable              Non-Renewable              Exhaustible           Inexhaustible






                    Water       Sunlight       LPG        Mineral      Petrol       Coal        Air       Sunlight

                 • Renewable: Resources which occur in abundance and are renewed on their own by our mother nature through
                the natural process of recycling, replacement, and reproduction are called renewable resources. For example,
                forest, wind, water, sunlight, geothermal (energy from the heat inside the earth).
                 • Non-Renewable: Resources that are limited and cannot be replaced at the same speed at which they are used
                up are called non-renewable resources. It takes millions of years to form inside the earth. For example, fossil
                fuels, minerals, natural gases, nuclear energy, etc. Non-renewable resources can be called inorganic resources if
                they come from non living things. For example, minerals, LPG and rocks.
                 • Exhaustible: Resources which are present in limited quantity and will deplete after a few hundred years due to
                their over consumption by human activities. For example, coal, petrol, natural gas, water, etc.
                 • Inexhaustible: Resources which are present in abundance and cannot be exhausted even by their over
                consumption are called inexhaustible resources. For example, wind, solar energy, etc.

              Natural resources come in many forms. It may be a solid, liquid, or gas. It may also be organic or inorganic. It may
              also be metallic or non-metallic.

                 • Land Resources: Human beings use land as a resource for production as well as residence and recreation. It
                is a finite resource subject to both agricultural and non-agricultural uses, such as infrastructure development.

                   presence of trees. Wood is used for making furniture, tool-handles, railway sleepers, matches, ploughs, bridges,
                   boats, etc. and as a source of energy for cooking purpose and for keeping warm. Tannins, gums, drugs, spices,
                   insecticides, waxes, honey, horns, musk, ivory, hides, etc. are all provided by the flora and fauna of forests.
                    • Water Resources: Water covers about three quarters of Earth's surface and is a necessary element for life. Water
                   resources include rivers, lakes, oceans, and underground aquifers, etc. Water is a vital resource in agriculture,
                   industrial, household and recreational and environmental activities.
                    • Mineral Resources: A mineral deposit is a concentration of naturally occurring solid, liquid, or gaseous material,
                   in or on the Earth's crust in such form and amount that its extraction and its conversion into useful materials or
                   items are profitable now or may be so in the future. Mineral resources are non-renewable and include metals
                   (e.g., iron, copper, and aluminium), and non-metals (e.g., salt, gypsum, clay, sand, phosphates). Some minerals
                   consist of a single element, such as gold, silver, diamond (carbon), and sulphur.
                    • Food Resources: Resources that are used as food, or provide food for organisms are called food resources.
                   Plants serve as food resources for herbivores and omnivores. Animals and birds are the source of food for many
                   organisms who are carnivores and omnivores. Agriculture is the main source of plant food resource for human
                   beings.
                    • Energy Resources: An energy resource is something that can produce heat, power life, move objects, or produce
                   electricity. There are 5 fundamental sources of energy:

                     Nuclear fusion in the Sun (solar energy)
                     Gravity generated by the Earth and Moon

                     Nuclear fission reactions
                     Energy in the interior of the Earth
                     Energy stored in chemical bonds

















                               Non-renewable Resources                    Renewable Resources


                 Most of the energy we use today come from fossil fuels. But fossils fuels have a disadvantage in that they are
                 non-renewable on a human time scale, and causes other potentially harmful effects on the environment.

              Natural Resource is the main reason for our existence on this planet. Many natural resources are present in the
              environment in abundance, some resources can ultimately perish due to increase in population and industrialisation.
              It is important to conserve these natural resources by doing our part in saving it for our future generation. The
              direct or indirect consumption of natural resources across the globe has led to their rapid depletion. As a result of
              this many countries of the world are calling for better means of managing and sustaining these natural resources.

              Need to Conserve Our Natural Resources
              We need to conserve our natural resources because of the following reasons:
                 • For our survival.
                 • To maintain our environmental balance.
                 • It is an important factor for the economic development of a country.
                 • It takes millions of years to replenish non-renewable resources.
                 • Due to increase in population and rapid urbanisation, these resources are getting exhausted at a higher rate.




                            Brainy Fact


                     China has the most natural resources estimated to be worth $23 trillion, 90% of which are coal
                     and rare earth metals.



              How To Conserve Our Natural Resources
              Natural Resources are consumed by living organisms directly or indirectly for their existence. Conservation of
              natural resources helps in maintaining an ecological balance. We can conserve it for our future generations by
              protecting it in different ways as discussed below:

              Water Conservation
              Water is an essential natural resource for the existence of life. Our body is made up of 70% of water. We need water
              for agricultural, industrial, household and recreational activities. We can conserve water by using the given measures:
                 • By doing rainwater harvesting.
                 • Setting up water treatment plants to reuse the water for irrigation or other purposes.
                 • Judiciously using water at homes, restaurants, social gatherings and workplaces.
                 • Growing more vegetation in rain deficient areas to trap rainwater and hold underground water.
                 • Proper disposal of sewage and industrial wastes, so that it does not contaminate the water bodies around it.

                 • Building dams and reservoirs.

              Soil Conservation
              Soil contains important minerals which are used as nutrients for plants. These plants are the basis of food for all
              living organisms including man. Soil is also a home of many microorganisms that fix nitrogen and decompose
              organic matter. Loss of soil and its fertility can be due to several reasons like land overuse, erosion, salinisation,
              and chemical contamination. We can conserve soil by using the given methods:
                 • Afforestation: Planting more trees on the land with few or no trees is called afforestation. Trees are used to
                anchor the soil and reduce the amount of soil erosion undergone by that area. It also helps to offset excess

                   land is carved into steps for planting crops. Each step has a mud barrier to prevent the washing away of soil
                   nutrients by the rain water. It also helps in reducing water loss and soil erosion.
                    • Changing Agricultural Practices: Retaining soil nutrients and preventing soil erosion can be done by following
                   changed agricultural practices like:



















                     Crop Rotation: It is the system of cultivating different varieties of crops on the same piece of land across different
                     seasons. This helps to conserve soil fertility as different crops have different requirements of soil nutrients.

                     Contour Ploughing: In this method, the soil is ploughed along the contour to decrease the soil runoff. By
                     growing the crops in a contour pattern, plants can absorb more rain water and thus minimise the soil erosion.

                     No-Till Farming: It is a method of growing crops without tilling the soil. This practice will not disturb the top
                     layer of soil and the last crop present in the top layer will be decomposed fast which helps in maintaining the
                     soil nutrients and preventing soil erosion.
                    • Wind Breaks: Dense rows of tall evergreen trees are planted around the boundaries of farm. This reduces wind
                   pressure and helps in preventing soil erosion due to wind and rain water.
                    • Salinity Management: The water, after evaporating from the soil, leaves behind salt. It is generally seen in the areas
                   near sea, lakes, oceans and in weathering of rocks. It affects soil fertility and reduces absorption of water by plant.
                   Using humic acids can prevent this or growing crops like saltbush can rejuvenate soil and replenish lost nutrients.
                    • Earthworms: Earthworms are considered as best friends of farmers. By introducing more earthworms, we can
                   increase the fertility of soil. They eat up the soil and fungi present in it due to no-till farming, digest the organic
                   matter present in it and excrete wastes full of plant nutrients known as worm cast which makes soil fertile. They
                   aerate the soil by making burrows.
                    • Stream Bank Protection: During the rainy season or floods, the vegetative cover of the stream bank is often
                   washed away into the stream, leading to soil erosion. This can be prevented by forming vegetation, constructing
                   rock ripraps, planting trees, and growing native grasses and shrubs along a stream bank.


                 Energy Conservation
                 Energy conservation involves preserving of non-renewable
                 resources like coal, oil, and natural gas by using it judiciously
                 and reducing its wastage, so that it can be preserved for
                 the  generations  to come. Increase in the  consumption
                 of oil and natural gas has lead to an increase in the level
                 of carbon dioxide causing change in climatic conditions.
                 There are different ways to conserve energy:






                                                                                               Green Skills-I   143]]></page><page Index="146"><![CDATA[• Using alternate sources of energy: There are many alternate sources of energy that can be utilised for different
                purposes:
                   Wind Energy

                   Geothermal Energy
                   Solar Energy
                   Nuclear Energy

                   Tidal Energy
                   Biofuels and Biomass Energy
                 • Using  energy efficiently: This is an  important  factor  for  environmental  protection,  financial  benefits for
                individuals and for the country as a whole.  Following the method given below will be a great help in the
                consumption of energy efficiently:
                   Using maximum daylight, CFLs, turning off electrical appliances when not in use.

                   Using energy efficient appliances at home and in offices. It consumes less energy and saves more money.
                   Using public transport, carpooling, driving less, and walking more or using a bicycle for small distances.
                   Keeping the doors closed for efficient use of air conditioners.
                 • Creating awareness  among  people: If we create awareness  among our people, then half of the battle in
                conserving energy is won. This awareness can be brought by:

                   Educating people for efficient use of energy at homes and in offices.
                   Supporting campaigns and government initiatives for consumption of alternate sources of energy.
                   Going for Reduce, Recycle, Repurpose, Refuse and Reuse of the available resources.


              Food Conservation
              Natural Resources used as food for the living organisms are called Food Resources. Conservation of food resources
              will help retain the nutritional value of food and avoid its wastage. It serves to feed mankind in times of adverse
              conditions like war, natural calamity, food shortage due to climatic change, etc.

              The given methods for conserving food are used at different stages of food transfer from producer to consumer
              level:
                 • Cooling: Certain varieties of food can be refrigerated, while others can be frozen to stop the growth of harmful
                microorganisms like bacteria, mould, fungi, etc. on the food, thus preventing it from being unfit for consumption.
                 • Heating: Microorganisms are destroyed by heat at specific temperature. This process includes pasteurisation,
                cooking, and sterilisation.
                 • Removing moisture from food: This will hinder the growth of microorganisms on food by drying, salting,
                pickling, sugaring, and smoking food.

                 • Use of preservatives: Food preservatives like Sodium Benzoate, Parabens,  Formaldehyde, etc. are used to
                increase the shelf life of food items by keeping it fresh for a long time.


              Forest Conservation
              Forest is an important renewable resource and is made up of living and non-living components. It has plants in
              the form of trees, shrubs, climbers, grasses, and herbs. It provides us food, fodder, fibre, fruits, and fuel. It also
              regulates the temperature of a place and helps in conservation of soil.

                    • Control deforestation: Due to rapid urbanisation and the construction of dams, forests are cut to clear land.
                   Cutting should be regulated by :

                     Clear cutting method: If the same types of trees are available
                     over a large area, then trees of the same age group can be cut
                     down in a selected area and then marked for replantation.

                     Selective cutting method: Only mature trees are selected for
                     cutting. This process is to be followed in rotation.

                     Shelter  wood cutting method: Trees are cut  on  the  basis of
                     their utility of providing timber. Trees of lesser importance are
                     cut first, followed by trees of moderate importance and at the end the best trees are considered.
                    • Control forest fire: Fire in forests sometimes occurs due to natural processes like lightning strikes or friction
                   between trees during high-speed winds. Sometimes, intentional or unintentional human activities may also
                   cause fire in forest. Precautions must be taken for such incidents like making fire lanes, spreading chemicals
                   to control fire, clearing out dry leaves and trees, etc. There must be a trained staff of fire-fighters to control
                   the fire.

                    • Afforestation and Reforestation: Afforestation is the process of planting more trees on land with few or no
                   trees i.e. creating a new forest. Reforestation is the process of planting more trees in an existing forest with
                   less number of trees due to forest fire or excessive cutting. These two methods will help restore the natural
                   vegetation which is important for maintaining the ecological balance.




                              Brainy Fact

                        Russia has the largest number of trees in the world, estimated at 642 billion trees. Next is Canada with
                        318 billion trees, and Brazil with 302 billion trees.





                         Saving Environment using 5R’s

                 With the rising population all over the world, we are constantly in the process of production and consumption of
                 natural and man-made resources. This has led to generation of waste products of different types. The organic waste
                 is decomposed on its own but the inorganic waste like plastic does not decompose naturally and accumulates for
                 years. The modern waste management techniques using 5R’s—Repurpose, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Refuse will
                 definitely help in managing our waste sensibly, so that there is less damage to our environment.
                 Let us study what we need to do to follow 5R's in our daily practice of waste management:













                   REPURPOSE                 REDUCE REUSE                        RECYCLE               REFUSE



                                                                                               Green Skills-I   145]]></page><page Index="148"><![CDATA[Repurpose

              It refers to finding a new use or function for something that was originally intended for a different purpose. It's
              about creatively finding ways to extend the lifecycle of an item rather than disposing of it.
                 • Transforming old clothing into cleaning rags.
                 • Using glass bottles as decorative vases.
                 • Repurposing wooden pallets into furniture.
                 • Turning old furniture into garden planters or using glass jars as storage containers.


              Reduce
              By reducing waste, we reduce the use of resources, so that there are less efforts for waste management.

                 • Avoid printing non-essential documents. If needed, print on both sides of the page.
                 • If something  has to be  bought  in large  quantities,  then  buy  in bulk altogether  to reduce  packaging  and
                transportation.
                 • Buy products that can do more than one thing.
                 • Buy reusable items rather than disposable ones.
                 • Carry your own reusable shopping bags to avoid using plastic bags.
                 • Reduce the use of single-use plastics, plastic packaging, and styrofoam cups.


              Reuse
              Reuse of the products will save the cost of making disposable products. This will help in saving more money which
              will work in favour of the country’s economy and ultimately less of waste to manage.

                 • Second-hand stores should be opened in various locations, so that people can send their things like clothes,
                toys, utensils and other products which are of no use for them and others in need can reuse them.
                 • Give unwanted toys and books to NGOs and people in need.
                 • Use reusable packaging material for food and other items.


              Recycle
              Recycle is the most eco-friendly method of waste disposal. In this process, the waste material is reproduced to
              create another product which can be used for some other purposes.
                 • People should be encouraged to buy products that are made from recycled materials.
                 • Automobiles' parts, cans, construction material, etc. are all made of metals that can be recycled.

                 • Any plastic bottle or container for food storage must be recycled.

              Refuse

              In an environmental context, "refuse" means to actively choose not to use or accept something, especially items
              that are wasteful or harmful to the environment.
                 • Refusing single-use plastic bags by using reusable cloth bags instead, or refusing to buy products with excessive
                packaging.
                 • Refusing single-use plastics like straws and bags.
                 • Avoiding products with excessive packaging.
                 • Saying no to disposable utensils and opting for reusable ones.

                 Some of the human activities, which cause damage to the environment are over-exploitation of resources, pollution,
                 deforestation, mining, destruction of natural habitats, construction, etc. Let us now discuss how some of these
                 activities are damaging our earth and environment.
                    • Over-exploitation: This results when  harvesting of resources exceeds their  reproduction  or replenishment.
                   It means that when we exploit the species faster than the natural populations can recover, then it may result
                   in extinction of the species, thus affecting directly or indirectly the ecological cycle and our environment. For
                   example, removal of wild medicinal plants, excessive grazing of pastures by animals, destruction of forests, and
                   water aquifers, overfishing and over hunting, results in over-exploitation of forests and natural habitats.

                    • Mining: Mines are dug below the earth's surface to get ores. The ores are then refined to extract the valuable
                   elements, such as metals, gems, minerals, etc. Some of the environmental impacts of mining include erosion,
                   formation of sinkholes,  loss  of biodiversity, and contamination of soil,  groundwater and surface water by
                   chemicals from the mining processes.
                    • Deforestation: It is the clearance of a forest or stand of trees where the land is converted to a non-forest use,
                   such as agriculture and construction of houses. It results in loss of habitat for many plants and animals living in
                   the forest. It may also lead to extinction of plant and animal species.
                    • Pollution: This word is derived from the Latin  word "polluere" meaning "to soil"  or "defile (contaminate)".
                   Pollution is caused by pollutants, which may be solid, liquid, or gaseous in nature. Pollution is the effect of
                   undesirable  changes in our surroundings that  have harmful effects on plants, animals, and  human beings.
                   Pollutants are produced due to human activity, which have a detrimental effect on our environment.
                   For example, factories consume a lot of water and electricity and release harmful chemicals in air, land, and
                   water, thus contaminating the atmosphere. Water pollution caused by factories and other industries can be the
                   most serious problem. They also pollute the air through fossil fuel emissions. These emissions include carbon
                   dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, which are harmful to living beings.
                 Pollutants are of two types:

                           Pollutants that can decompose                     Pollutants that cannot decompose

                  Pollutants that break down into simpler, harmless   Pollutants which cannot be broken down into simpler
                  substances naturally (by the action of moisture and   and harmless substances are called non-biodegradable
                  bacteria) are called biodegradable pollutants.    pollutants. The harmful effect caused by these
                                                                    pollutants will be there for hundreds of years.


                  Examples: vegetable waste, sewage waste, paper,   Examples: plastics, insecticides, pesticides, chemicals like
                  wood, cattle dung, agricultural waste from organic   mercury or lead, aluminium, glass, etc.
                  farms, etc.
                 Some of the other factors responsible for polluting the environment are as follows:

                    • Exhaust fumes released from vehicles pollutes the air.
                    • Excessive use of chemicals in agriculture (like insecticides and fertilisers) affect the alkalinity of the soil or the soil
                   pH. It adversely affects the health of microorganisms and other organisms in the soil.
                    • Plastic waste like bottles, bags, etc., thrown on land and sea pollutes the water and destroys the flora and fauna.
                    • Dangerous gases (chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs, methane, carbon dioxide, etc.) released into the air.

              Climate Change
              Global warming refers to the increase in the average  temperature of the Earth's atmosphere mainly due to
              greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, CFC's) produced by a lot of human activities. It has resulted in melting of
              glaciers, rising sea level and intense heat waves all across the globe. It is one of the major environmental issues, as
              it creates an ecological imbalance and has become a reason for the extinction of many plant and animal species.

                    • Excessive use of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas produces greenhouse gases-like methane, nitrous oxide and
                   mainly carbon dioxide which trap the sun’s radiation within the atmosphere resulting in rise in global temperature.
                   This is called green house effect.
                    • Trees absorb CO  from the atmosphere and release oxygen instead, so they work as air purifiers. Deforestation
                                  2
                   due to urbanisation and industrialisation has reduced the number of trees on the earth. This has resulted in the
                   increase of carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere.
                    • Over-consumption of natural resources due to population explosion has also contributed to global warming.
                    • Increase in pollution is also responsible for the rise in global warming.
                 Greenhouse gases that occur both naturally and from human activities include water vapour, carbon dioxide (CO ),
                                                                                                                       2
                 methane (CH ), nitrous oxide (N O) and ozone (O ). Other greenhouse gases have essentially no natural sources, but are

                 the side products of industrial processes or manufactured for human purposes, such as cleaning agents, refrigerants,
                 and electrical insulators. These include the fluorinated gases: chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons
                 (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). This greenhouse effect causes snow to melt very fast. Carbon dioxide emissions
                 into the atmosphere from burning oil, coal and gas for energy use is a serious problem as it is harmful to the environment.
                 Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by 31%  since  pre-industrial times,  causing more heat to be
                 trapped in the lower atmosphere. As a result, there are frequent floods and changes in climate as well as damage
                 to crops and animal life.


                 Harmful Radiation
                 You might be knowing that the atmosphere protects us from harmful radiation from the sun. This is done by a
                 layer all around the earth, in the atmosphere, called the "Ozone Layer". It is made of a gas called 'Ozone'. This layer
                 in the atmosphere protects us from the harmful radiation.
                 Cleaning chemicals, coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners, etc., release ozone depleting substances, such
                 as chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere. These destroy the ozone in the atmosphere, making holes in the ozone
                 layer. The harmful radiation comes in through these holes and causes increased incidence of health disorders, such
                 as skin cancer.

                 Natural Disasters

                 Natural disasters include floods, earthquakes, landslides, storms, etc. Our actions in exploiting natural resources
                 for building structures, such as large dams and buildings sometimes aggravates the impact of natural calamities
                 and disasters.

                 Mining Activity

                 Mining is the process of extracting useful minerals from the earth’s surface. It is estimated that two-thirds of the
                 world’s yearly mineral production is done by surface mining.

                                                                                               Green Skills-I   149]]></page><page Index="152"><![CDATA[If we keep on extracting minerals from our natural resources, then it will create an ecological imbalance. So many
              country’s government allows only a limited number of mining activities to be done that too under its supervision.
              Sometimes humans for their own profits indulge in illegal mining without realising the importance of preserving
              these natural resources. A lot of legal or illegal mining activities all across the globe are responsible for significant
              environmental damage:



















                 • Acid  mine drainage,  which  is the  formation  and  movement  of  highly  acidic  water  rich  in  heavy  metals,
                contaminates the surrounding water bodies.

                 • Mining can deplete surface and groundwater supplies.
                 • To get the land for mining, the forest in that area is destroyed. This has a negative impact on the plants and
                animals living in that region.

                 • When the mining is over and that area is abandoned, then it creates wastage of land which is suitable neither
                for industrial use nor for agricultural purpose.


              Saving the Environment
              To save our environment, we need to educate people. Education is important, as it gives people the knowledge and skills
              that they need to perform. Educating people about the environment, through the environment and for the environment
              will enlighten them in utilising their knowledge and skills for saving the environment as responsible citizens.
                 • Learning about the environment: Learning about the environment focuses mainly on acquisition of knowledge
                and understanding of our surroundings and related issues.
                 • Learning through the environment: Learning through the environment refers to the processes of learning
                while being engaged with the environment inside and outside the classroom. It focuses on the learning process,
                such as observation, hands-on experience, learning-by-doing, problem-solving through an exposure to the
                environment and learning. The direct contact with the environment provides the relevant context for acquiring
                knowledge, skills, aesthetic appreciation, and practical experience to learning. Environment damage can be
                minimised by developing the skills and knowledge required for efficient resource utilisation, green processes
                and technologies and integrating these into our businesses and daily activities.
                 • Learning for the environment: Learning for the environment aims at the development of an informed response
                and responsibility towards the environment.

                    Since 1870, global sea levels have risen by about 8 inches due to global warming. Arctic is one of
                    the worst places to be affected by global warming.

                         What is Sustainable Development?


                 Sustainable development was defined in the World Commission on Environment and Development 1987 Brundtland
                 Report "Our Common Future" as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the
                 ability of future generations to meet their own needs".
                 "Sustainable development is the development that satisfies the needs of the present without compromising the
                 capacity of future generations, guaranteeing the balance between economic growth, care for the environment, and
                 social well-being".
                 The purpose of sustainable development is to keep a balance between the economic, environmental, and social
                 needs. It requires the active participation of individuals, businesses, administrations, and countries around the
                 world to find better ways of doing things so that the present generation can give back to nature, for our future
                 generations to thrive. All the nations across the globe need to stand together to contribute in small actions to
                 bring long-term sustainability of the environment for sustainable social and economic growth.
                 It will help companies with innovative technologies flourishing all across the globe, people will have better jobs,
                 everyone will be able to afford nutritious foods without moving out of their native place, living in clean, healthy
                 setup with proper sanitation facility, they will have quality and affordable education, and technical advancement to
                 bring social and economical equality while keeping the environment safe.
                 Sustainable development includes the following:
                    • reducing excessive use of resources and enhancing resource conservation.
                    • recycling and reuse of waste materials.
                    • scientific management of renewable resources, especially bio-resources.
                    • planting more trees.
                    • using more environment friendly material or biodegradable material.
                    • green, grassy patches to be interspersed between concrete buildings.
                    • use of technologies, which are environmentally friendly and based on efficient use of resources.

              The Sustainable Development Goals also known as the Global Goals, are a universal approach for improving our world.
              These 17 interconnected universal goals approved by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015 and are expected
              to be achieved by the year 2030. They serve as a blueprint for creating a better and more sustainable future for all.

              These goals will help all the nations across the world to design their national development plans for the next
              15 years in such a way that it should end poverty and hunger, bring peace and justice and sustain our natural
              resources with minimum climate changes, food, and agriculture with less damage to mother Earth.

              The SDGs have been framed with the objective of addressing vital issues facing businesses, governments, and
              society. These include poverty, gender equality, water use, energy, climate change, and biodiversity.
              Countries are now establishing policies  and regulations that will promote sustainable systems  needed in all
              economic sectors to provide a secure, affordable, and sustainable economy. The core skills identified as necessary
              for the green worker include environmental awareness and willingness to learn about sustainable development as

              Green Growth

              The concept of green growth aims at achieving economic growth that is socially inclusive and environmentally
              sustainable. The Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change, Government of India recognized green
              growth in its vision, wherein 'poverty eradication' along with green growth is to be seen as the focal point for green
              economy. The Finance Commission of India articulated green growth as involving "rethinking growth strategies
              with regard to their impacts on environmental sustainability and the environmental resources available to poor
              and vulnerable groups." The extent to which its economy will "grow green" will depend on its ability to reduce the
              quantity of resources required over time to support economic growth that leads to enhancement of social equity
              and job creation. Green growth could play an important role in balancing these priorities. To ensure sustainable
              development, any activity that is expected to bring about economic growth must also consider its environmental
              impacts so that it is more consistent with long term growth and development.

                         Green Economy


                 The term “Green Economy” was first coined in a 1989 report for the Government of the United Kingdom by a
                 group of leading environmental economists, entitled "Blueprint for a Green Economy". There is no internationally
                 agreed definition of a green economy but many countries have realised that the country’s economy and the
                 balance in the environment go hand in hand. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has defined the
                 green economy as “one that results in improved human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing
                 environmental risks and ecological scarcities. It is low carbon, resource efficient and socially inclusive”.
                 It is an effort of the whole world to create a healthy planet by using alternative ways of growth and development
                 that improve quality of life of people through sustainable development. It also means healthy clean air to breathe,
                 pure water to drink and wholesome food to eat for all without exhausting our present natural resources and saving
                 it for the future generations to come.




























                 Characteristics of Green Economy
                 Environmentally sustainable development has become the main goal of all the countries across the globe since
                 the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in 1992. It emphasises that the Green Economy
                 provides prosperity for all within the ecological limits of the planet. It focuses on:
                    • Well-being and prosperity for all people by providing good education, decent livelihoods, and jobs.

                    • Supporting human rights and social equity especially the rights of under-privileged and minorities.
                    • Nurturing the geographical boundaries to safeguard, restore and invest in nature. It protects the biodiversity
                   and natural ecosystems.
                    • Creating  prosperity  within  planetary boundaries  for  sustainable production  and  consumption. It provides
                   economical growth by aligning prices, subsidies, and incentives with true costs to society.
                    • Good governance by adapting sound science and economics along with local knowledge. It prioritises public
                   participation, informed consent, transparency, and accountability.

              The key challenges for India are to expand access to food, energy, water, and other essential goods and services
              to its growing population. It needs to work towards the objective of alleviating poverty and catalysing sustainable
              development. The development of skills for green jobs is crucial to ensuring an efficient transition from unsustainable
              to a green economy by matching supply and demand for skills. A green job can be found in business, non-profit
              organisations, government, or education.

              Some green jobs may have specific requirements for green skills, such as an organic farmer needs to have knowledge
              and skills for growing organically certified crops. Solar technicians or engineers should possess the knowledge and
              skills for design, installation and maintenance of solar panels and appliances. Other green jobs may not necessarily
              require specific skills. For example, a graphic designer or a cashier working for a green company or organisation
              will be contributing to the development of green growth and economy.


              Components of Green Economy

              There are six basic components of a Green Economy:
                 • Renewable Energy: Energy produced by renewable sources like wind, sun, water, etc. is called renewable energy.
                Using these as the alternate sources of energy will help reduce the impact on the environment.

                 • Green Buildings: Buildings which causes minimum destruction to the environment during its construction and
                use renewable energy with proper waste management are called green buildings.
                 • Green Transport: It supports a well-planned transportation system with minimum damage to the forest and
                environment. It also promotes efficient use of fuel that produces minimum greenhouse gases and also uses
                alternate sources of fuel like CNG, battery, etc.
                 • Water Management: It is to reduce the wastage of water and replenish the groundwater level by adopting
                rainwater harvesting. Using rainwater for agriculture, wastewater for recycling, etc. reduce scarcity of water.
                 • Waste Management: It is managing  the  waste by  adopting  5R's—Repurpose,  Refuse,  Reduce,  Reuse and
                Recycle  for minimum environmental degradation.
                 • Land Management: It is judicious use of land resources like soil, forests, farms, roads, etc. without causing
                much damage to the environment.


              Importance of Green Economy
              The Green Economy is an innovative method of improving the country’s economy with minimum environmental
              degradation. Its major benefits are:


              Environmental Benefits
              Environmental benefits of green economy are:
                 • It helps in decreasing environmental pollution, which is a big effort to protect the environment without degrading
                the quality of soil, water and air.
                 • It helps in reducing the negative impacts of greenhouse gases by adopting technologies and products that
                minimise carbon emissions. This will work in reducing global warming.
                 • Less damage to our forests and biodiversity will help in survival of rare species on the earth.
                 • It helps in eco-friendly, sustainable management of natural resources.
                 • It brings conscious inclination towards the alternate sources of energy.

                 Economic benefits of green economy are:
                    • It brings economic growth through the establishment of new markets for biofuels and other renewable energy
                   resources.
                    • This will develop new markets with specialised, trained and skilled manpower.
                    • Creation of more eco-friendly industries will bring more employment, security and stability in the society.
                    • Agriculture industry will also believe in promoting the growing of pesticides and chemical free crops.


                 Social Benefits
                 Social benefits of green economy are:
                    • It improves the health and well-being of the society which increase the productivity of the country and reduce
                   the costs of health care.
                    • It improves livelihood status and poverty rate.
                    • It reduces environment related health problems.

                         Green Skills

                 The specialised skills which are important for building or developing Sustainable Green Economy are called Green
                 Skills. Learning green skills is one of the major ways to enhance knowledge, abilities, values, and attitudes to
                 develop and support organisations that focus on improving environmental conditions.

                 With scientists all across the globe repeatedly warning about how our environment is being seriously damaged by
                 our actions, it has become necessary for us to learn the importance of implementing Green Skills in all possible ways.
                 The government of India launched the Green Skills Development Programme (GSDP) in India in the year 2017.
                 This was started by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change MoEFCC in partnership with National
                 Skill Development Agency (NSDA). It aims to develop green skilled workers having technical knowledge and
                 commitment to sustainable development. It will help in attainment of Nationally Determined Contributions
                 (NDCs), Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), National Biodiversity Targets (NBTs) and Waste Management
                 Rules 2016.
                 Some of the areas in which green skills contribute to the sustainable development are as follows:

                    • using renewable energy (example, using solar power and wind energy)
                    • water and waste management
                    • rain water harvesting
                    • conserving energy
                    • reducing pollution
                 Green skill is crucial for making a transition from energy and emissions-intensive economy to cleaner and greener
                 production and service. It also prepares people for green jobs that contribute to preserving or restoring the quality
                 of the environment, while improving human well-being and social equity. Many technologies have been developed
                 to make use of solar energy, such as solar lights, solar cookers, solar water heaters, etc. The installation of the solar
                 panels and appliances requires engineers and technicians.
                 Environmental change can be seen as an important factor that affects labour demand and skills supply across all
                 sectors, such as Automotive, Retail, Electronics, Power, Construction, etc., which impacts the economy. Green Skills
                 thus, are the skills that aim to balance economic development with environmental conservation so that the needs
                 of the society, economy and environment are efficiently met, with minimum damage to the environment.

                       Green Projects in India


              The environment friendly projects that aim to reduce pollution, fossil fuel consumption or some other positive
              effects on the environment are called Green Projects. India is making rapid progress in various areas of clean and
              green technologies. Many profit and non-profit organisations and startups have joined hands with the Government
              of India to help the country progress in terms of promoting and protecting the environment. Some of the Green
              Projects of India are:
                 • Digital Green: It is a multimedia solution for rural education, Digital Green is a not-for-profit organisation
                 partnered with local public, private and civil society organizations to build innovative platforms to enable rural
                 communities to create and share knowledge on improved agricultural practices, livelihoods, health, and nutrition
                 using locally produced videos.
                 • Solid Waste Management by ‘Swachh Cooperative’: This green project is wholly owned by waste pickers. The
                 Cooperative has members who are engaged in door step collection of waste in Pune. This integrates informal
                 waste pickers into Pune city’s Solid Waste Management System.
                 • Bio-toilet by ‘Green Solution Foundation’: GSF (Green Solution Foundation) has created a bio-toilet solution
                 for hygienic sanitation in villages and slums that lacked sewage systems.
                 • Feeding India: This green project takes leftover food to the poor. This is done by helping the needy get access
                 to excess cooked food from restaurants and caterers.
                 • HelpUsGreen: This green project recycles waste flowers. Kanpur-based HelpUsGreen makes 'flowercycled'
                 natural and certified organic products from flowers. They collect flower waste from places of worship and even
                 the Ganges river and repurpose it into vermicompost, incense sticks and bathing bars through proprietary
                 methods.
                 • SayTrees: This green project conducts tree plantation drives. SayTrees is a professionally-run group of people
                 that is determined to protect the environment by sensitising others towards the importance of environment
                 conservation.

                 • Fourth Partner Energy: This green project makes solar energy accessible. It was founded in 2010 by Vivek
                 Subramanian,  Saif Dhorajiwala  and  Vikas Saluguti. Fourth Partner  Energy (4PEL)  focuses on financing  and
                 building rooftop solar projects for commercial, industrial, and residential clients. It recently raised $125 million
                 in equity funding from Norwegian investment fund Norfund and existing shareholder, The Rise Fund.

                         in its natural ways by encompassing  interaction  of all living  species  and natural  resources, it forms  our natural
                         environment. Plants and animals living on land, in air, or water form our natural environment. It may be claimed as
                         Abiotic and Biotic.
                       •   Man-Made Environment: It is the environment created by humans to create an atmosphere comfortable for him
                         to interact and adjust to the natural environment. For example, permanent human settlements like villages, towns,
                         cities, transport and communication facilities, factories, dams, etc.

                Ans.  The main causes of Global warming are as follows:
                    •   Excessive use of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas produces greenhouse gases-like methane, nitrous oxide and
                      mainly carbon dioxide which trap the sun’s radiation within the atmosphere resulting in rise in global temperature.
                    •  Trees absorb CO  from the atmosphere and release oxygen instead, so they work as air purifiers. Deforestation due
                                    2
                      to urbanisation and industrialisation has reduced the number of trees on the earth. This has resulted in the increase
                      of carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere.
                    •  Overconsumption of natural resources due to population explosion has also contributed to global warming.
                    •  Increase in pollution is also responsible for the rise in global warming.
                  3.  How mining activities all across the globe are responsible for significant environmental damage?
                Ans.  Mining activities worldwide contribute to significant environmental damage through several activities:
                    •   Acid mine drainage, which is the formation and movement of highly acidic water rich in heavy metals, contaminates
                      the surrounding water bodies.
                    •  Mining can deplete surface and groundwater supplies.
                    •  To get the land for mining, the forest in that area is destroyed. This has a negative impact on the plants and animals
                      living in that region.
                    •  When the mining is over and that area is abandoned, then it creates wastage of land which is suitable neither for
                      industrial use nor for agricultural purpose.
                  4.  Give three important characteristics of the Green Economy.
                Ans.  The three important characteristics of the Green Economy:
                    •  Well-being and prosperity for all people by providing good education, decent livelihoods and jobs.
                    •  Supporting human rights and social equity especially the rights of under-privileged and minorities.
                    •  Nurturing the geographical boundaries to safeguard, restore and invest in nature. It protects the biodiversity and
                      natural ecosystems.
                  5.  Give two necessary reasons for adapting to the Green Economy.

                Ans.  Adapting to the Green Economy is necessary for two key reasons:
                    •  It is an effort of the whole world to create a healthy planet by using alternative ways of growth and development that
                      improves quality of life of people through sustainable development.
                    •  It also means healthy clean air to breathe, pure water to drink and wholesome food to eat for all without exhausting
                      our present natural resources and saving it for the future generations to come.

                  6.  Define the Green Projects in India. Give examples.
                Ans.  The environmentally friendly projects that  aim to reduce pollution, reduce  fossil  fuel consumption or  some other
                    positive effects on the environment are called Green Projects. For example:
                    •  Digital Green: It is a multimedia solution for rural education.
                    •  Solid Waste Management by ‘Swachh Cooperative’: This green project is wholly owned by waste pickers.
                    •  Bio Toilet by ‘Green Solution Foundation’: it has created a bio-toilet solution for hygienic sanitation in villages and
                      slums that lacked sewage systems.

                  7.  Give any four environmental benefits of the Green Economy.
                Ans.  The four environmental benefits of the Green Economy are:
                    •   It helps in decreasing environmental pollution, which is a big effort to protect the environment without degrading
                      the quality of soil, water and air.
                    •  It helps in reducing the negative impacts of greenhouse gases by adopting technologies and products that minimise
                      carbon emissions. This will work in reducing global warming.
                    •  Less damage to our forests and biodiversity will help in survival of rare species on the earth.
                    •  It helps in eco-friendly sustainable management of natural resources.

                 Since ancient times, humans have tried to be better than others and moved forward with the creation of tools
                 that aided them to stay ahead of every other living being. In an attempt to make life easier, humans tried to make
                 machines intelligent and smarter. These days we have machines that can think and respond in ways similar to
                 human being. This is how the concept of smart machines came into existence. In this chapter, we will explore how
                 that change happened and how we came so far.

                         What is Intelligence?


                 Intelligence  is the  ability  to  learn  from experience,  recognise  problems and  solve  problems. According  to
                 Sternberg—”Intelligence is the capacity to learn from experience, using metacognitive processes to enhance
                 learning, and the ability to adapt to the surrounding environment.”

                 Intelligence is the capacity to learn and behave adaptively. It can be defined as a person’s ability to think and to
                 learn. For example, students are considered intelligent if they understand the subject content and are able to score
                 above-average grades.

              machines with intelligence like humans and having qualities like perception [the acquisition of information and rules
              for using the information], reasoning [using rules to reach the approximate or definite conclusions], and learning
              [self-corrections]. The term Artificial Intelligence is made up of two words: Artificial and Intelligence.


                                                          Artificial Intelligence



                                      Artificial                                      Intelligence



              Artificial means “human-made” and Intelligence means “ability to think and make decisions”. In simple words,
              Artificial refers to the things made by humans and Intelligence refers to the ability of people to think and learn
              from their past experiences.

              Artificial Intelligence covers a wide range of systems and applications that have the ability to think and act like
              humans. It is used for creating machines with programmed algorithms which can take decisions like humans do.

              AI has made a greater impact on humanity than any other innovation till date.



                            Brainy Fact


                      In 1956, John McCarthy first coined the term “Artificial Intelligence” and defined it as the
                      science and engineering of making intelligent machines. Later in 2006, he was referred to as
                      the “Father of Artificial Intelligence”.




                       Types of AI


              AI has already become an integral part of our daily life, therefore, it’s important to understand what AI can
              actually do. In fact, AI is a broad term which includes Machine Learning, Big Data, and Natural Language

              Processing (NLP) as its subsets. These subsets can also be classified by the level of intelligence.
              AI can be classified into three categories:
              •  Weak AI                   • Strong AI                  • Super AI



                                                          Artificial Intelligence



                                      Weak AI                 Strong AI                 Super AI



              Let us learn about them in detail.

                 It is also known as Narrow AI. It is the most common type of AI that we can see and use all around us. Characteristics
                 of this AI are as follows:

                    • It performs dedicated tasks with intelligence.
                    • It cannot perform beyond its capabilities. It is trained to perform a
                   specific task. It fails in unpredictable situations.
                    • Apple’s Siri is a good example of Weak AI systems. It is a digital virtual
                   assistant that operates within a predefined limited range of operations.
                    • Even IBM’s Watson Supercomputer comes under the category of weak
                   AI. It is an expert system that combines machine learning and natural
                   language processing.
                    • Some other  examples include self-driven cars, image processing, e-commerce  websites using chatbots,  AI
                   system playing chess, etc.


                 Strong AI
                 It is also termed as General AI. Machines with the following
                 characteristics will fall into this category:

                    •  Machines that would perform a wider range of different
                   tasks with intelligence similiar to that of humans.
                    •  It is a step ahead of Weak AI by including problem-solving,
                   learning, and development.

                    •  At present, we have not developed any such machines.
                    •  Worldwide research is now focused on developing machines with Strong AI.

                    • As these systems are in their research stage, it may take a lot of time and effort to develop them.
                    • An example of Strong AI could be a machine hearing "good morning" and deciding to turn on the coffee maker.


                 Super AI

                 Super AIs are in their hypothetical stage. The following are the characteristics of Super AI:
                    • Systems that surpass human intelligence in performing any task will fall into the category of Super AI.

                    • Super AI will be able to understand humans and evoke their own emotions and desires as well.
                    • It can be considered as the next stage of Strong AI, and developing such machines will be a challenging task.


                                  Weak AI                               Performs specific task



                                                                              Performs a wider range of
                                                    Strong AI               different tasks with

                   1.  Which movies have you seen about artificial intelligence?


                   2.  How intelligent will artificial intelligence become by 2030, any guess?

                   3.  At present, in what activities are computers better than humans?





                       How do Machines Become Intelligent?


              Artificial Intelligence makes the machines intelligent. Programming along with some aspects of human intelligence
              like decision-making and problem-solving, gives rise to intelligent machines. Machines are fed with enough data
              and correct algorithms to make them intelligent.



                                    Data         +          Algorithm        =          AI Machine

                   Make two teams. There will be a bowl of chits with words, circle, square, white, tall, green, and wet. Based
                   on the chit selected, both teams will have to name a thing. If, a team would not be able to name a thing
                   correctly, will lose the game. For example:
                   Team 1: Word-Round

                   Team 2: Cake
                   Team 1: Ball

                   Team 2: Apple
                   Team 1: Bangle

                   Team 2: Pencil
                   Team 2 loses.

                   The purpose of this activity is that the students will become aware of how machines identify a real-life
                   object based on some criteria. In the example criterion is a round object.



                       AI Around Us

              When you pick up your smartphone to click a picture, it turns to portrait mode, here you use AI whether you know
              it or not. From the notifications that you received on your social networking account to the advertisements of the
              upcoming new web series, everything is AI-curated.

                    • Smartphones: The  built-in smart  assistants (like  Siri) are some
                   obvious  examples  of  AI.  Google’s  AI-powered  predictions  have  a
                   visible impact on every person’s life. The portrait mode of the camera
                   in our smartphone is also an AI feature. It makes the background blur
                   while focusing on the foreground object.


                                                       • Email  Spam  Filters: Email categorisation  and  spam filters are some
                                                      powering features of AI that affect our inbox. Simple rule-based filters are
                                                      used to mark spam or put email into various categories as Primary, Social,
                                                      Promotion or Important.


                    • Virtual  Assistants:  Smart  virtual  assistants that  we  use to  control our  smart
                   house are prime examples of AI impacting our daily lives. They use AI to study our
                   behaviour and patterns so that they can adjust themselves automatically. They
                   are capable to do several things like send quick messages, set reminders, check
                   the weather and get the latest news.


                                 • Social Media: When you are posting a picture on your social media account, the social media
                                account automatically identifies the people and gives suggestions to tag them. From the feeds

                                to see on the timeline to the notifications that you receive from these apps are all AI-based.


                    • Music  and  Media  Streaming  Services: Music apps like Spotify or media
                   streaming apps like Netflix, Hotstar, or YouTube are primarily AI-based apps
                   which make decisions for us. The type of content that you watch becomes the
                   base of the next recommendations for you.




                                                              • Video Games: AI is used to control the creation of characters,
                                                             animals or machines in games. The machine makes moves and
                                                             actions based on the input given by the player.






                    • Navigation: AI takes charge of your navigation through Google Maps, Uber, or even when booking
                   flights/hotels. The apps used to make reservations use AI to give you suggestions for alternate
                   routes to be taken to avoid traffic. When you book your cab, it uses AI to give suggestions for
                   both pricing and the type of car.



                                                  • Security and Surveillance: AI-enabled security cameras cover the footstep
                                                 and do the analysis of the moves taken by the intruders. They are smart
                                                 enough to do real-time monitoring.

                            Brainy Fact


                    In December 1955, Herbert Simon and Allen Newell developed the Logic Theorist, the first artificial
                    intelligence program.




                       What is Not AI?


              Every automated gadget around us is not necessarily AI-based. The following are some examples of gadgets that
              are not AI-based:
                 • Fully Automatic Dishwasher: It can work on its own but requires input from humans. You can select different
                parameters and commands, and based on your choices, the necessary action is taken. Hence, it is an example
                of automation and not AI.

                 • IP-Enabled Security Cameras: They can be accessed remotely with the help of the internet but still need a
                human touch. So, it is an example of the Internet of Things (IoT).
                 • Robots: They are generally considered intelligent, but some robots that can only perform one task based on
                a specific instruction. These robots are extremely efficient, but they are not intelligent. For example, industrial
                robots are built for one type of task only, and they cannot perform anything else.

                       Importance of AI

              AI has impacted all the fields and sectors. It has changed the conventional functioning of machines. AI means
              equipping machines  with the power to think and make decisions  just  like human beings. Machines become
              intelligent with Machine Learning. We provide information to the machines to make them learn from their patterns
              and behave intelligently.

              Let us understand some of the importance of AI:
                 • Reduce Time and Increased Accuracy: With the invent of AI, real-life problems that involve long and complex
                 calculations can be done faster with more accuracy. For example, price comparison websites use long algorithms to
                 choose the right plan for you after performing the comparison of prices.
                 • Making of Robots: AI enables the creation of robots capable of performing tasks beyond human capabilities.
                 In pandemic time, when humans are vulnerable to virus attacks, robots can be easily used for vaccination and
                 patient care. With the help of AI, such robots can be made.
                 • Automation: With virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, etc. and chatbots, AI have significantly simplified daily tasks.
                 The feedback of a food delivery app is an example of a chatbot using AI.

                 • Assist for Differently Abled Individuals: AI-based software and hardware are available in the market that assist
                 differently abled individuals to do their tasks. Awaz, BillionAbles and Let Me Hear Again are some examples,
                 which uses AI to augment the abilities of individuals with disabilities.

                       AI in India


              AI as a technology has evolved in every field. It is the fastest-growing sector with India having the biggest stake in
              AI development. This technology has its roots in our country’s leading technology institutes. These institutes have
              initiated and encouraged AI researchers and startups.

              The Deccan Article notes that the first Community Centre for Artificial Intelligence was launched in Hyderabad.
              They also mentioned that The HexArt Institute is an initiative of the Hexagon Capability Center India (HCCI). The
              center will train over 350 students in several batches per year.
              The favourable ecosystem, economy and the vast pool of talent in India have brought many big companies of the
              world like Google, Microsoft, IBM, etc. to set up their research centers and AI labs in India.

              Recognising the AI potential to transform economy and development, NITI Aayog was set up to establish the
              National programme on AI. NITI Aayog has partnered with leading AI technology stakeholders to implement AI in
              critical sectors—Medical and Agriculture. The strategy is known as #AIforAll, which implements the growth of AI at
              school level and go up till research.

              INDIAai is the National AI Portal of India. It is a central hub for everything related to AI in India. It is a joint initiative
              of Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY), National e-Governance Division (NeGD), and NASSCOM.

                      In 2019, CBSE introduced AI as a skilled subject for grades 8 and 9. It’s the first board in the world
                      to introduce it as a discipline at a school level.





                         Human-Machine Interaction

                 Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) can be defined as the communication or interaction between humans and
                 machines through a user interface to fulfil a specific task or operation. With the help of the user interface, a human

                 communicates with a computer while working on the computer. In human-machine interaction, hardware and
                 software plays a major role.

                 Nowadays,  natural user interfaces (NUIs) have gained
                 attention of the humans. NUI is a type of sensory input
                 system that is invisible to the user. They allow humans
                 to interact with the machine in natural ways like touch,
                 speech, and gesture. The main aim of an NUI is to create
                 seamless interaction between the human and machine.
                 In this type of HMI, sensors are used to capture human
                 postures and motions. For example, the Microsoft Kinect

                 sensor captures your body movement and controls the character in the game.

                 Now, let us learn about the domains of AI.

                         Domains of AI


                 As we have discussed in the previous segment, human intelligence is composed of various domains like perception,
                 reasoning and learning. Similarly, Artificial Intelligence is also composed of three domains which are Data Statistics,
                 Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. They are quite distinct from each other; they together constitute
                 the concept of artificial intelligence.

                 When we interact with an AI machine, we actually interact with these domains of AI. HMIs are done through these
                 three domains of AI:



                                                               Domains of AI







                               Data Statistics                Computer Vision                 Natural Language
                                                                                                 Processing






                                                                         AI Reflection, Project Cycle and Ethics  177]]></page><page Index="180"><![CDATA[Data Statistics

              Data and data statistics are crucial elements in the realm of data analysis,
              providing the foundation for extracting  meaningful insights  and making
              informed decisions. Under this domain, the type of input data can be numeric
              (0–9), text (A–Z or a–z), or special symbols (#, @, $, etc.). The collection,
              analysis, interpretation,  presentation,  and  organisation of  data  are  called
              data statistics.

              More the data, the better will be the analysis and the more accurate would
              be the prediction. Thus, AI requires large amounts of data to find the latest
              trends and patterns. For example, I plan to organise a social gathering in an
              open-air setup in the month of August in Delhi. I will have to look for a weather forecast for the same and also
              look at the previous years' trends. So, data collection is the base for analyses and pattern recognition models. From
              those patterns, predictive models can be made.
              So, the data is the most important part of an AI machine. After the data is collected from different sources, the AI
              machine analyses the data and then processes it.


                                                                             #Experiential Learning

                      4.  What approach was the machine following while playing against you?




                      It is a game based on data statistics domain of AI where the machines try to predict the next move of
                      the participant. It is made on similar rules as a basic rock, paper and scissors game we played in our
                      childhood days. Learning from the previous moves of the player the machine tries to win ahead with
                      the participant. With every game, the machine is learning from your moves, and able to play it better.




                 Computer Vision

                 We use our vision to sense and identify objects around us. In the same way, AI machines use the computer vision
                 domain to understand their surroundings. Computer Vision (CV) is the domain of artificial intelligence that is used
                 to train computers to read, process, and analyse visual data in the same way as humans do. The type of data in CV
                 is images and videos. The AI machine collects data from digital images and videos, and then process the data to
                 identify the objects in the image/video. For example, a self-driven car scans live objects, like traffic signals, analyses
                 the scanned image, and then creates the 3D version of it. After that, the car decides whether to run or stop. Some
                 other applications of CV in AI are facial lock in smartphones, unusual behaviour detection, object classification,
                 home security systems, office security systems, and drone-based surveillance systems.

                require maximum effort and time. Starting from staff recruitment to automated packing of products, AI has the
                potential to increase productivity.
                 • Smart Decision Making: AI helps in making smart decisions. Salesforce Einstein Analytics is a comprehensive
                AI for CRM (Customer Relationship Management), designed to enable companies to make smarter business
                decisions. The goal of this technology is to give sales and marketing departments more comprehensive customer
                behaviour and sales prospects.
                 • Solve Complex Problems: AI is used to solve complex problems that cannot be solved by human beings. Through
                the years AI has progressed from simple machine learning algorithms to advanced machine learning concepts that
                have helped resolve complex problems like fraud detection, medical diagnosis, weather forecasting and so on.
                 • Strengthens Economy: AI is estimated to contribute $15 trillion to the world’s economy by 2030. It is estimated
                that the greatest impact of AI will be in the field of healthcare and robotics. The rise in the economy will mainly
                be from the substitution of work by automation and increased innovation in products and services.
                 • Personalisation: Personalisation techniques can be simplified using AI. It is now easiest to target customers
                with  the right product.  Thread,  a UK based fashion company  uses AI to provide personalised clothing
                recommendations to each customer.

                 • Global Defense: The most powerful robots in the world are built with global defence in mind. One example of
                AI in global defence is The AnBot. The AI-based robot developed by the National Defence University can carry
                out automatic security patrols and guards against terrorists and rioters.
                 • Disaster Management: Precise weather forecasting assisted in planning outdoor events easier. But even the
                smallest advancements in predicting the weather, majorly impacts the market. Accurate forecasting allows the
                farmers to make critical decisions about planting and harvesting.
                 • Enhances Lifestyle: AI is branching out into every aspect of our lives and helping us live a better life. We use
                AI systems to interact with our phones and speakers through voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google. Cars
                made by Tesla using AI for self-driving cars. Even Google gives us recommendations based on our activities.

                       Disadvantages of AI


              Elon Musk says “AI is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilisation.”
              The important thing to remember is the consequences of your actions while applying AI. Some of the disadvantages
              of AI are:
                 • Expensive Technology: As AI is advancing day by day, the hardware and software need to get updated with
                time to meet the latest requirements. Setting up AI-based systems requires high costs because of the complexity
                of the engineering that goes behind its making.

                   in manufacturing, agriculture, food service, retail, transportation, logistics,  and hospitality are some  of the
                   industries likely to be affected. The majority of the repetitive tasks would be taken over by AI.
                    • Lacks  Emotions  and  Creativity: AI machine lacks  human emotions  and creativity. AIs can become skilled
                   machines but they can never acquire the abilities of humans. The creativity of AI is only limited to the ability of
                   humans that created them.
                    • Does Not Improve with Experience: Humans learn from experiences, whereas it's not possible with machines.
                   AIs cannot alter their responses based on the changing environment. They are programmed to behave in a
                   specific manner, so they cannot make decisions in case they encounter an unprogrammed situation. If a change
                   is required, they need to be re-programmed.

                         AI Project Cycle Framework


                 Before learning about the AI project cycle framework, let us first learn about the traditional software development
                 cycle. Traditional software development follows the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).




                                                                         AI Reflection, Project Cycle and Ethics  187]]></page><page Index="190"><![CDATA[SDLC has the following stages:

                            Requirement
                              Analysis




                                          System Design




                                                      Implementation



                                                                      Testing




                                                                                 Deployment




                                                                                              Maintenance



              As you can see in the above diagram, the first stage is Requirement Analysis. It is the stage where we have to
              analyse the required data and information. The next stage is System Design in which we design data flow diagrams
              like flowcharts from the analysed data to demonstrate the flow of data in the software to be developed. The next
              stage is Implementation in which the real programs are written. After developing the programs, we need to test
              the written programs to solve the problem for which the programs are written. If the program is tested successfully
              then the software is deployed in the client location.

              Similar to SDLC, the AI project cycle is the process of converting the real-life problem into an AI-based model. The
              project cycle framework is designed to help project managers guide their projects successfully from start to end.
              The purpose of the project life cycle is to create an easy-to-follow framework to guide projects. The AI project cycle
              provides us with an appropriate framework which can lead us towards our goal.


              Stages in an AI Project Cycle

              The AI project cycle involves several key stages, each building upon the previous one to develop, deploy, and
              maintain an AI system effectively. These stages are as follows:

                                                                Problem
                                                                Scoping


                                                                              Data
                                                Deployment
                                                                            Acquisition




                                                                               Data
                                                 Evaluation
                                                                            Exploration


                                                               Modelling

                    188     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-IX]]></page><page Index="191"><![CDATA[• Problem Scoping: The first stage of an AI project cycle is problem scoping to identify the problem and have
                   a vision to solve it. Problem scoping refers to understanding a problem and various factors which affect the
                   problem, and finding a solution for it using AI technology. The 4W’s of problem scoping are Who, What, Where,
                   and Why. These Ws help in identifying and understanding the problem in a better and efficient manner.
                    • Data Acquisition: The next stage of the AI project cycle is data acquisition. The term data acquisition means
                   collecting raw data for the purpose of reference or analysis for the project. The data can be in the form of
                   text, numbers, images, videos, or audio and it can be collected from various sources like Internet, journals,
                   newspapers, and so on. The data acquisition system allows us to obtain valuable information about reality to
                   improve the performance of the project.
                    • Data Exploration: Data exploration refers to the techniques and tools used to visualise data collected in data
                   acquisition through complex statistical methods. It is the process of analysing a large dataset.
                    • Modelling: It is the design phase of the AI project cycle. In this, we select the best way to reach the solution.
                   It requires the process of selecting the right algorithm to develop a working model for the project. In this
                   step, different models based on the visualised data can be created and even checked for the advantages and
                   disadvantages of the model.
                    • Evaluation: It is the testing phase of the AI project cycle, where we check if the model can achieve required
                   goals or not. If the model is not fulfilling the requirements, the model or even the data can be changed. Once
                   the developer feels the project is ready, the project will be put into working conditions and then deployed and
                   handed over to the user. If the deployment stage is not reached, the project is of no use.

                    • Deployment: In this stage, we integrate the best-performing model into the production environment, setting
                   up continuous monitoring, and maintenance to sustain performance over time.

                 The AI project cycle is a structured framework comprising stages from problem definition and data acquisition to
                 model development and deployment. It involves identifying objectives, gathering data, exploring and modelling
                 data, evaluating outcomes, and deploying AI solutions. This iterative process ensures systematic development,
                 validation, and improvement of AI applications aligned with business goals and user needs. We use an AI project
                 cycle for these important reasons:
                    •  Structure and Organisation: Provides a clear roadmap and systematic approach for planning,
                   executing, and managing AI projects, ensuring all steps are followed in a logical sequence.



                                 •  Efficiency: Optimises resource allocation, time management, and task prioritisation throughout
                                 the project lifecycle, leading to more effective and timely project outcomes.



                                                                         AI Reflection, Project Cycle and Ethics  189]]></page><page Index="192"><![CDATA[•  Risk Management: Facilitates early identification and mitigation of risks related to data quality,
                model performance, deployment challenges, and ethical considerations, minimising potential
                disruptions.


                               •  Quality Assurance: Ensures rigorous testing, evaluation, and validation of AI models to meet
                              desired performance standards and business requirements, enhancing reliability and usability.


                 •  Continuous  Improvement: Supports iterative development and enhancement of AI solutions
                based on feedback, new data insights, and evolving business needs, fostering innovations, and
                adaptation over time.



                              •  Modularity: Encourages the design of AI solutions in a modular fashion, allowing components
                              to be developed, tested, and integrated independently, promoting flexibility and scalability in
                              project development.

                                               Case Study: Cleaning Oceans

                   The world's oceans are increasingly polluted with plastic waste, which poses a severe threat to marine life
                   and ecosystems. Identifying the location and density of plastic waste patches is challenging due to the
                   vast and dynamic nature of the ocean. Traditional methods of detecting and removing plastic waste are
                   inefficient and labour-intensive. Coastal communities and environmental organisations lack the advanced
                   tools  needed to monitor and clean up these plastics  effectively, leading to continued environmental
                   degradation and harm to marine biodiversity.
                   Can we solve this problem with AI? How?
                   Now that you are aware of AI concepts, plan to use them in accomplishing your task. Start with listing
                   down all the factors which you need to consider saving the oceans. This system aims to:






                     Problem Scoping: Define the problem statement, objectives, and constraints of the AI project. Identify
                     stakeholders, understand the business context, and outline the scope of work to be undertaken.

                   Define the scope to develop AI models for identifying and removing ocean plastic waste. Identify key
                   challenges such as ocean dynamics, plastic detection limitations, and scalability of cleanup efforts.

                     Data Acquisition: Gather relevant datasets required for training and evaluating AI models. Ensure data
                     is collected from reliable sources, adheres to legal and ethical standards, and is prepared in a format
                     suitable for analysis.

                   Gather  satellite imagery, drone footage,  and oceanographic data  from various sources to create a
                   comprehensive dataset.  Utilise  data  from environmental organisations, governments, and research
                   institutions.

                       relationships. This phase involves data cleaning, visualisation, and statistical analysis to uncover patterns
                       and insights that inform subsequent modelling.

                     Clean and preprocess the data to extract relevant features such as plastic concentrations, ocean currents,
                     and marine life habitats. Explore visualisation techniques to understand spatial and temporal patterns of
                     plastic waste.

                       Modelling: Develop and implement AI models  using appropriate algorithms and techniques. This
                       phase includes feature selection, model training, parameter tuning, and validation to optimise model
                       performance and accuracy.

                     Develop AI models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition to detect and
                     classify plastic debris  in ocean  images. Implement reinforcement learning  algorithms for  optimising
                     cleanup strategies based on real-time data.

                       Evaluation:  Assess  the  performance  of  trained  AI  models using evaluation  metrics and  validation
                       techniques. Validate model predictions against ground truth data to ensure reliability and generalisation
                       ability across different scenarios.

                     Evaluate model performance using different metrics to ensure accurate detection and classification of plastic
                     waste. Validate models with cross-validation techniques and real-world testing in different ocean regions.

                       Deployment: Integrate the validated AI models  into the operational  environment for real-world
                       applications.  Deploy  models  using  scalable  and  efficient  frameworks,  monitor  performance
                       post-deployment, and iterate as necessary to maintain effectiveness and relevance.

                     Integrate AI models into autonomous drones or underwater robots for real-time monitoring and cleanup
                     operations.  Implement cloud-based solutions for  scalable deployment across global ocean  regions.
                     Continuously  monitor  model  performance  and  refine  algorithms  based  on  feedback  from  cleanup
                     operations and environmental assessments.
                     By following this AI project cycle, we can effectively leverage technology to address the critical issue of
                     ocean plastic pollution, leading to improved marine ecosystem.

                     Let us map the steps of Cleaning Ocean project to the steps in the AI project cycle.

              Problem scoping is the term used to define the process of selecting a problem that we might want to solve using
              AI knowledge. Identifying a problem and then having a vision to solve it is called problem scoping. Let us start
              scoping a problem. Look around, we are surrounded by problems, big or small. At times we don’t feel the problem,
              as we are so used to them. Look around and select a theme that interests you the most from the following diagram:

              You can select any one from the above diagram. Further you can also select from the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.




























              In the context of problem scoping, a theme refers to a central topic or recurring issue that emerges from the analysis
              and exploration of a particular problem space. A theme is a broad term which covers all the aspects of relevance
              under it. Identifying themes in problem scoping is crucial as it helps to organise and focus the investigation that
              ensures the problem is understood comprehensively and that solutions are aligned with the core issues.

                 In highway construction, there are different issues related to land acquisition, land quality, deforestation, compensation,
                 raw materials, toll collection, etc. Although, these issues are different but are part of the same activity of highway
                 construction. In problem scoping, we take up one issue at a time and elaborate it for better understanding.

                 Let us fill the theme, topic and problems related to it in the following:

                         Identifying the Stakeholders


                 After setting the goal, we need to identify the people (stakeholders) who would be affected by the AI system when
                 it is developed. Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the project or are affected by its
                 outcomes. They can provide valuable vision, support, and feedback throughout the project.

                their jobs as AI systems will automate tasks and require less human interaction. Hence, no need to hire more
                employees.

                 • Management: AI system will reduce the cost of the company as it decreases the total number of employees
                required.
                 • IT Department: AI system will require a large amount of data to perform the tasks better. So, experienced and
                expert employees are required to collect data. More employees are also required to develop and maintain the

                AI system. The AI system will also require more storage space for large amounts of data.
                 • End users: Individuals or groups who will use the AI solution.
                 • Data providers: Entities or systems that supply the data used for training and testing the AI models.


                       4Ws Problem Canvas


              To understand step by step how problem scoping is done we use another method here, known as 4Ws Problem
              Canvas. This canvas helps us in identifying 4 crucial parameters we need to know for solving a problem.
              The 4Ws here are listed as Who?, What?, Where?, and Why?



                                  Who?                What?               Where?                Why?


              Who?
              Under the "Who" block, we analyse the people who are getting affected directly or indirectly by the problem. These
              people are the “stakeholders” of this problem. The stakeholders are the people who face this problem and would
              be benefitted by the solution.

              Let’s fill the "Who" canvas!


                       • Who are the stakeholders?



                       • What do you know about them?







              What?
              Under the “What” block, you need to check what is the actual problem. You determine the nature of the problem.
              Here, you also check what is the problem, and how do you know that it is a problem. To support the evidence of
              the existence of a problem, newspapers, govt. reports, print media can be considered.

                   changes with the season. Ensuring a clean drinking water supply is a challenge as demands are changing
                   with time as rivers shrink in summers, but the demand is more for water. Rivers swell in monsoon season,
                   but the demand is comparatively low to that of summer. The water demand further reduces in winter,
                   but there is ample water in the rivers. Autumn sees the demand almost the same as that of summer. The
                   population of the city is also growing as more areas are getting covered under the residential housing
                   societies.

                 Using Problem Statement Template

                 People love to indulge in various kinds’ food. This is a reason that you find restaurants everywhere. These restaurants
                 serve food in many ways like A la-Carte and Buffets in-order to offer a variety to their customers. All kinds of Food
                 Outlets prepare food in bulk, as they expect a lot of customers would come to enjoy the food every day. For most
                 Food Outlets, at the end of the day, there is a lot of leftover food. This food is a waste, as the Food Outlets don’t
                 intend to serve stale food to their customers the next day, to maintain their brand value.

                 So, every day a specific quantity of food is prepared keeping in mind a probable number of expected customers,
                 which might be more than the actual number of customers who visit. This leads to a good quantity of food getting
                 wasted, which is a loss for the restaurant as they need to dump the food or pass it on free to the NGO’s feeding
                 hungry people. Everyday wastage if accounted for the whole year is a big loss for the restaurants.
                 Now, we have understood the scenario well. Let us take a deeper look into the problem to find out more about
                 various factors around it. Let us fill up the 4Ws problem canvas to find out.

                       Iterative Nature of Problem Scoping


              In the AI project cycle, problem scoping is a very important phase. If it is not handled properly and has flaws then
              it could lead to failure of the project as well.
              The iterative process is an important approach of problem scoping that helps in continually improving a design or
              product using an AI model. It involves creating a prototype and testing it, and repeating this cycle until you reach
              a desired AI model. The main advantages of using an iterative approach in problem scoping are:
                 • Each iteration helps you improve based on the problems identified in the past cycle.
                 • It is cost effective as the problem is identified and continual testing gives you a clear picture of the status of
                 your project.
                 • Testing and debugging are easier with smaller and initial iterations.
                 • You can present the results of each iteration to stakeholders and clients and help you showcase the efficient
                 progression of the project.


                       Ethical Issue Related to Problem Selection

              When identifying an issue for an AI project, consider how it will influence individuals as well as society. These are some
              important ethical issues:
                 • Fairness: Make sure that the AI system does not unfairly favour a particular group above others.
                 • Privacy: Ensure that the AI system protects the confidentiality of individuals and never collects or uses private
                data of individuals without their consent.
                 • Transparency: People should know how exactly the AI system functions as well as why specific choices are made.
                 • Social impact: Examine how the AI system may influence society as a whole, and how it might encourage biases
                or cause of social divisions.
                 • Environmental impact: Examine how AI system could have negative impacts on the environment. For example,
                consuming a lot of electricity or emitting pollutants.


                       Data Acquisition

              Data acquisition means collecting raw facts, figures, or statistics from relevant sources either for reference or for
              analysis needed for AI projects. In the process of making an AI project cycle, data acquisition is the second stage.
              It is a time-consuming process as different types of data are scattered everywhere, and we need to focus on data
              relevant to our needs.

                    198     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-IX]]></page><page Index="201"><![CDATA[While acquiring data, you need to collect data in a regular bases or timely manner to ensure it is up-to-date and
                 reflects current conditions or trends. You need to also ensure that the data you acquired is complete and sufficient.
                 If you don't have sufficient data, your analysis may be incomplete or unreliable.


                 What is Data?
                 Data is a piece of raw information or facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis. They are raw
                 facts that need to be processed to get meaningful information. Whenever we want the AI project to be able to
                 predict an output, we need to train it with a data set first. Data plays an important part in an AI project as it creates
                 the base on which the AI project is built.


                 Types of Data
                 There are two types of data:
                    • Training Data: It is data on which we train our AI project model. It is basically to fit the parameters of the project
                   for the model. In training data, the output is available to the model.

                    • Testing Data: It is used to check the performance of an AI model. In testing data, the data is not seen for which
                   the predictions have to be made.
                 For example, if we want to prepare an AI model to predict the school average of students in board examinations,
                 we will feed the marks obtained by students in board examinations in the previous years, this will be treated as
                 training data. Once the model is ready, it will predict the school average for the coming year. Now when we are
                 testing it, we feed the different datasets and that is the testing data.


                 Data Features

                 In the data acquisition stage, it is very important that the data we provide to an AI project is relevant. How do we
                 know what data to be used in a problem scoping?

                    • We need to visualise the factors that affect the problem statement, for which we need to extract the data features.
                    • We need to find out the parameters that will affect the problem statement directly or indirectly.
                    • Data features refer to the type of data that you want to collect. In the above example, the data features would
                   be each subject average, the number of students taking the exam, the theory and practical marks distribution
                   of each subject, etc.


                 Reliable Sources of Relevant Data

                 Data is the base for any AI project to be built. When the data is acquired, it's important to check if it's from a
                 reliable and authentic source for the accuracy of the project.
                 Also, the acquisition methods should be authentic so that there's no conflict in achieving project goals.

                 There are various sources to collect relevant data for our project:
                    • Surveys: Data can be collected from online surveys, telephonic surveys or in-person surveys to collect responses.
                   Surveys are a way of collecting data from a group of people to gain information and insights into various topics
                   of interest. The process involves asking people for information through questionnaires which can be online or
                   offline. It can be considered as a data source.
                    • Web Scraping: Data or information can also be extracted from a website. Web scraping or Data scraping is the
                   method of downloading information from the World Wide Web (WWW) and storing it on your computer for
                   later reference. The data collected in this way is online data.

                                                                         AI Reflection, Project Cycle and Ethics  199]]></page><page Index="202"><![CDATA[• Sensors: Data can also be collected from various sensors like collecting environmental data and stored in some
                 data storage solutions. Sensors are connected through gateways which enable them to collect live data in the
                 offline mode.
                 • Cameras: Data can be seen, written down or recorded on the computer. Cameras are used to collect data in
                 the form of images. CCTV, web cameras, and surveillance cameras are big sources of visual data that can be
                 acquired from various places.
                 • Observations: It is a method of collecting data by watching facts as they occur. Using the observation technique,
                 data can be analysed and used for testing the model.
                 • Application  Programming  Interfaces  (APIs): APIs  are a set of functions and procedures that allow one
                 application to connect to another. So, one of the ways of collecting data is through APIs that can be used to
                 collect data from social media services for analysis.
              There are times when,  using the  internet,  we acquire unauthentic  data  from websites for  our  AI project.
              Extracting private data can be an offence. So, keeping this in mind we should ensure the data is collected from
              open-sourced websites hosted by the government. They are one of the most reliable and authentic sources of
              information. These portals have information collected in a suitable format that can be downloaded. Some of the
              open-sourced government portals are data.gov.in, india.gov.in, etc.
              After listing the data features, let's understand the concept of system maps.

              System Maps
              A system map is a diagrammatic representation of a set of things working together. It focuses on the components
              and boundaries of a system. System map helps us to find relationships between different elements of the problem
              which we have scoped. It helps to find a solution to achieve the goal of our project. Let us understand system maps
              with the help of an example.
              Streets are safe for pedestrians to walk if the number of people driving on the roads are less.

              If the number of vehicles on the road increases,                                 –
              the emission levels also increase.
              We use system maps to understand the complex
              issues that have inter-connected factors affecting                      –                +
              each other. A system comprises:                              Driving        Safe Streets       Walking
                 • Elements: These are different, discrete elements
                 within the system.
                                                                          +
                 • Interconnections: These are the relationships
                 that connect the elements.
              Rules for system maps are as follows:               Emissions
                 • The circles represent elements.

                    • The ‘+’ and ‘-’ signs are indicators of the nature of a relationship. The arrowhead depicts the direction of the
                   effect and the sign (+ or -) shows their relationship.
                    • If the arrow goes from X to Y with a + sign, it means that both are directly related to each other. That means if
                   X increases, Y also increases and vice versa.
                    • If the arrow goes from X to Y with a -sign, it means that both elements are inversely related to each other. That
                   means if X increases, Y would decrease and vice versa.

                         Data Exploration

                 After collecting accurate data, the next step is data exploration. Data exploration means finding the patterns
                 and trends in the data. It is the third stage in the AI project cycle and the initial step in data analysis. It is used to
                 understand what is in a dataset and the characteristics of the data.

                 Data exploration cleans the big data to provide an input to an AI project. Terabytes of data sitting in the data centre
                 unused is a burden, if correctly processed it can become digital gold.

              Data visualisation is the graphical representation of data and information. By using graphical tools like charts and
              graphs, it is an easier way to understand the trends and patterns in data.
              Data visualisation can be done through a combination of automated tools and manual methods. It encompasses
              all aspects of the visual representation. It helps you arrange your scattered data into a structured pattern with
              specific characteristics following important trends in detail. It also helps to make better decisions.

              Why do you think we need to explore and visualise data before jumping into the AI model? The following are some
              reasons:
                 • Understand trends: Visual representation of data grabs our interest and keeps our concentration. If we see
                 data in the form of numbers, understanding it will take some time. But when we see the same data in the form
                 of a chart, we quickly see trends and outliers.

                 • Deciding which model: Understanding visuals by humans is better than any tabular data format or reports.
                 Data visualisation tools accelerate decision-making based on the data insights, accelerating business growths.
                 • Easier to comprehend: Visualisation is a key tool to make sense of huge data in the form of rows. A good
                 visualisation tool helps to clean  big data  and  highlight useful information.  It enables decision-makers to

                 interrelate the data to find better insights and be easy to comprehend.
                 • Easier to communicate: Visualisation lets you communicate large amounts of data to the audience with ease.
                 Interactive data visualisation tools help to communicate data findings and critical information effectively.


              Need of Visualising Data
              The needs for data visualisation are:

                 • It simplifies the complex quantitative information.
                 • It analyses and explores big data easily.
                 • It identifies the areas for improvement.

                 • It identifies the relationship between data points and variables.
                 • It explores new patterns and reveals hidden patterns.


              Data Visualisation Tools

              There are both manual analysis and automated analysis tools available for data visualisation. These tools help
              us to visually explore and identify relationships between different datasets. Some of the commonly used data
              visualisation tools are:
                 • Microsoft Excel: It is a manual data exploration tool provided by Microsoft. It provides different types of basic
                 charts and objects for visualising data. However, it is limited to use only for representing small amounts of
                 organised datasets. It is not preferable for big data.
                 • Tableau Public: It is free software allows us to create interactive data visualisations that we can share with
                 others. It has very large datasets. It is one of the most commonly used data visualisation tools.

                 • Microsoft Power BI: It is a data visualisation tool provided by Microsoft. It is freely available to download and use.
                 • Datawrapper: It is one of the most commonly used data visualisation tools in media sector. It uses .CSV files to
                 create charts and maps.
                 • Google Data Studio: It is a part of Google Marketing Platform and allows us to create multiple views of our data.

              Modelling or data modelling is defined as the process of designing decision-making algorithms that have to
              be trained on a set of data (which was acquired at the data acquisition stage for the problem you scoped in the
              problem-scoping stage) and applying that learning to recognise certain types of patterns.

              Once the data is visualised and trends are formed, we need to work with algorithms to prepare the AI model. This
              can be done by designing our models or using the existing AI models. Before we go into the details of modelling,
              let us first understand the following important terms:
                 • Artificial Intelligence: AI refers to any technique that enables computers to mimic or imitate, develop, and

                 demonstrate human intelligence. They are machines that can perform tasks that they are programmed for. AI
                 enables machines to think without any human intervention.
                 • Machine Learning: Machines need to learn the ways of humans by learning the techniques and processes. So
                 machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses statistical methods that enable machines to

                 improve with experiences. So machines learn from their mistakes and take them into consideration in the next
                 iteration,  this  way  they  keep  improving  with  experience.  For  example,  Snapchat  filters  and  Netflix
                 recommendations.

                 • Deep  Learning: Machines can draw  meaningful inferences from  large            Intelligence
                 volumes of datasets. In deep learning, the machine is trained with a huge
                 amount  of  data,  which  helps it train  itself.  Deep  learning  is a  machine    Machine

                 In AI modelling, we develop different algorithms called models, which can be trained to produce intelligent output.
                 In other words, we write code to make a machine artificially intelligent.
                 AI modelling techniques can be broadly classified into two approaches, namely, rule-based and learning-based.
                 Let us learn about them in detail.


                 Rule-Based Approach

                 Rule-based approach is based on a set of rules and set of facts already fed to the machine to generate the desired
                 output. These models can operate with simple basic information and data. The relationships or patterns in the data
                 is defined by the developer.

                 To explain it further, let's take an example. You have a dataset comprising 100 images of cars and 100 images of
                 cycles. To train your machine, you feed this data and label each image as either a car or a cycle. Now if you test
                 the machine with an image of a car, it will compare with the trained data and according to the labels of the trained
                 data it will identify it as a car. This is called a rule-based approach. The rules given to the machine in this example
                 are the labels assigned to the training data.


                                                                                      Rule-based Approach


                                                                  Labelled Datasets



                                                                Used to Train Machine       Model

















                                                                      Output               Used for Testing  Training Data




                                 Machine Identifies the Image as Car                         Testing Data


                 Learning-Based Approach

                 Learning-based  approach  refers to  a  model where  the  relationships or  patterns in  the  data  are  not  explicitly
                 defined by the developer. In this approach, random data is fed into the machine and the machine develops its
                 pattern or trends based on the data outputs. It is an alternative method to address some of the challenges of rule-
                 based systems.

                 This approach is typically followed when the dataset fed to the machine is unlabelled and too random. The machine
                 tries to extract similar features and clusters them in the same datasets. In the end, the machine tells the trends
                 which are observed in the training data.
                                                                         AI Reflection, Project Cycle and Ethics  207]]></page><page Index="210"><![CDATA[For  example,  suppose  you  have  a  dataset  of  1000  images  of  flowers  in  your  garden.  Without  any  additional
              information about the flowers such as names, colours, or other features, it would be challenging to discern any
              patterns in this dataset. By employing a learning-based approach with an AI model, the machine could discover
              various patterns based on the features of these 1000 images. It might cluster the data based on colour, size, shape,
              etc. It might also come up with some very unusual clustering algorithm, which you might not have even thought of!


                                                                                      Learning-based Approach


                                                                  Unlabelled Data

                                                       Output is clustered based on patterns observed by the machine:
                                                           Left is based on colour, while Right is based on shape.



              Decision Tree—Rule-based Approach
              Decision trees are  tools that  follow  a  rule-based  approach  that  uses a  tree-like  model of  decisions and  their
              possible consequences. It is a kind of flow chart, where the flow starts at the root node and ends with a decision
              made at the leaves. It is used to depict conditions and their outcomes. It is one of the most widely used and
              practical methods for supervised learning.

              The decision tree starts from the root node just like the structure of a tree with two different ways or conditions:
              Yes or No. The forks or diversions are known as Branches of the tree. The branches either lead to another decision/
              question node or they lead to another condition for decision, which is known as the leaf node. If you look closely
              at the image, it looks like an inverted tree with roots above and leaves below. That's why it's called the decision tree.
              So let's revise some important terms related to the decision tree:
                 • Root node: A root node is the first node of a decision tree and it represents the entire set of data.
                 • Branching: Dividing the node at one level into two or more sub-nodes at the next level.
                 • Decision node: Dividing a node further into another level sub-node.

                 • Leaf node: A node that does not split further.
                 • Parent node: A node that is a level above a sub-node.
                 • Child node: A sub-node that falls under another node.

                 Following are some of the important points to consider while designing a decision tree:
                    • There can be a possibility of multiple decision trees that lead to correct prediction for a single dataset. The
                   simplest one should be chosen.
                    • The dataset might contain redundant data at times, which does not have any reference while creating a decision
                   tree. Therefore, only those parameters that affect the output directly must be included.
                    • While making decision trees, one should take a look at the dataset given to them and try to figure out what
                   pattern the output leaf follows. Try selecting any one output and on its basis, find out the common links that all
                   the similar outputs have.

              In computer vision applications, understanding pixels, resolution, and megapixels is crucial for processing images.
              The pixel is the smallest unit of digital images or displays. It is a tiny dot (smallest point) in a graphic image that
              stores colour and intensity details. Pixels work together to create the graphic that you view on your screen.

              Resolution refers to the clarity or sharpness of a picture or text seen on the display. It is the total number of pixels
              (tiny dots) that comprise the display. A higher resolution involves more pixels, which leads to an improved and
              more accurate image.
              The term megapixel refers to the resolution of digital cameras and camera sensors. It indicates one million pixels.
              For example, a 16-megapixel camera can capture photographs with a resolution of about 4928 x 3264 pixels that
              contain approximately 16 million pixels.
              Calculating the number of megapixels in an image involves a simple formula based on its resolution. The formula
              is:
                                                          Width in pixels × Height in pixels

              or images created on computers are pixel-based images. It shows how the computer classifies the images and
              reads them.

              Let us do an activity that helps us understand how the images are processed and classified by the computers.


                              Task                                                #Experiential Learning


                  Let us start with an activity. Follow the instructions step-by-step, as mentioned below:

                     • Cut out the matrix from the page given below or draw the same on a blank page with 6x6 square blocks.
                     • Write an uppercase letter on this matrix. The height of the letter should be equal to the height of this
                     matrix. In other words, it should start from the bottom line of the matrix to the top line. You can write any
                     capital alphabet in any handwriting.
                     • Now, colour the boxes on which the lines of that letter have fallen.

                     • After this, cut out horizontal stripes of the matrix such that it goes from 1–2, 2–3, 3–4, 4–5, 5–6 and 6–7.
                     • Now, paste all these stripes together to form a single paper string. Make sure that neither the last block
                     should be over the first block of the next line nor there should be any gap between the first and the last
                     blocks.
                     • Now, find those students in your class who have chosen the same letter as you.

                     • Put their paper strings under your string and add up all the coloured blocks to get a series of numbers. A
                     block without colour counts as 0, while the coloured ones count as 1. If a column has 3 coloured boxes,
                     the summation turns out to be 3.
                     • Now, get another student whose letter is different from yours. Put his paper string under your multiple
                     strings (of the same alphabet) and see if the pattern of coloured blocks is the same or not.
                     • Also, go to other groups and check if their summation series of numbers is the same as yours or not.

                     • Note down your observations in the end.

                       What is Evaluation?


              Model evaluation is the stage of testing the model where testing data is given to the system and the output
              generated is evaluated with the actual result to see the accuracy of the output and the reliability of the AI model.
              There can be different evaluation techniques, depending on the type and purpose of the model.

              Importance of Evaluation
              Evaluation is a process that critically examines a program. It involves collecting and analysing information about
              a program’s activities, characteristics, and outcomes. Its purpose is to make judgements about a program, to
              improve its effectiveness, and/or to inform programming decisions. Following are some of the advantages of
              evaluating an AI model:

                 • Evaluation ensures that the model is operating correctly and optimally.
                 • Evaluation is an initiative to understand how well it achieves its goals.
                 • Evaluations help to determine what works well and what could be improved in a program.


              Model Evaluation Terminologies

              Evaluation of an AI model can be done using various terminologies. Let us try to understand them with the help
              of a scenario.
              Scenario: An AI-based prediction model is deployed in schools. The model is supposed to predict whether the
              students of grade 10 will be able to get a “Perfect Score“ in the board exams this coming year or not. The model
              will check for whether the students will be able to score full marks in board exams in the coming year or not.

                 Prediction: It is the output given by the AI model using a Machine Learning algorithm.

                 Reality: It is the real scenario of the situation for which the prediction has been made.
                 Let’s look at the various combinations that can be considered for the above scenario.


                 Case 1: Is There a Perfect Score?






















                                      Predicion: Yes                                       Reality: Yes

                 Due to coaching institutes and a lot of easy access to online resources, it is not clear whether this would work in
                 their favour or not. Guidance and coaching are so readily available to all that most of them are prepared well for the
                 exams, but it can also lead to tougher papers to test them well. This makes getting a perfect score unpredictable.
                 We need an AI model that can predict whether the student can get a Perfect Score or not in the board exams so
                 that the students can timely plan their preparation and schedule to study as per the exam schedule.

                 In the above picture, we show the possibility of students scoring full marks in board exams for grade 10. The model
                 predicts a Yes, which means the student will get a Perfect Score in board exams to be conducted. The prediction
                 matches with the reality: Yes, therefore, this condition is called True Positive.


                 Case 2: Is There a Perfect Score?























                                      Predicion: No                                        Reality: No

                                    Predicion: Yes                                       Reality: No
                                                              False Positive


              Here, the reality is that there are no Perfect Scores due to difficult papers. However, the machine has incorrectly
              predicted that there will be a Perfect Score for the students of grade 10. This case is termed as False Positive.


              Case 4: Is There a Perfect Score?

























                                    Predicion: No                                        Reality: Yes
                                                              False Negative

              Here, the reality is that there is a Perfect Score due to the hard work of students, the availability of online resources
              and the right guidance at the coaching institutes. However, the machine has incorrectly predicted that there will be
              no Perfect Score for the students of grade 10. This case is termed as False Negative.

                 Confusion matrix is a tabular structure that helps in measuring the performance of an AI model using the test data.
                 The table is made with 4 different combinations of predicted and actual values (reality) in the form of a 2×2 matrix.
                 The comparison between the prediction and the reality can be used to analyse the rate of success. It also gives a
                 clear picture of which cases are being predicted correctly and incorrectly, and what types of errors are being made.

                 This matrix is also known as the Error Matrix and is used in situations where we need to evaluate the performance
                 of the model, where it went wrong and helps us find ways to increase the efficiency of the model. It is useful for
                 measuring recall, precision, accuracy and F1 score.
                 The following confusion matrix table illustrates how the 4-classification metrics are calculated (TP, FP, FN, TN), and
                 how our predicted value is compared to the actual value in a confusion matrix.

                                                                                           Reality

                 In the confusion matrix:

                    • The target variable has two values: Positive and Negative.
                    • The columns represent the actual values of the target variable.
                    • The rows represent the predicted values of the target variable.

                 For example:

                 In schools, a lot of times it happens that there is no transport facility available to commute. The unavailability of
                 school transport is a very common and prominent problem. Hence, an AI model is designed to predict if there is
                 going to be school transport available or not.

                 The confusion matrix for the same is:

                                                                                           Reality

              The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical representation that illustrates the performance of
              a binary classifier system at varying threshold values. It plots the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive
              Rate (FPR) at various threshold settings.
              This curve plots two parameters:
                 • True Positive Rate (Sensitivity) is the proportion of actual positive cases that are correctly identified by the
                classifier.
                                                                    TP

                 • False Positive Rate is the proportion of actual negative cases that are incorrectly classified as positive.
                                                                    FP

              To generate an ROC curve, you need to perform the following tasks:
                 • Vary the threshold of your classifier, usually ranging from 0 to 1, and calculate TPR and FPR at each threshold.
                 • Plot these TPR and FPR values on a graph. TPR is plotted on the y-axis, and FPR is plotted on the x-axis.

              Lowering the classification threshold classifies more items as positive, thus increasing both false positives and true
              positives. The following figure shows a typical ROC curve.

              the model that makes the best prediction.

                 The deployment phase is the last stage of the AI project cycle and is used when the AI model is put into use in
                 a real-world setting. This involves integrating the model into existing systems or applications, such as creating
                 Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) or embedding it directly into software. It also includes setting up the
                 necessary infrastructure, like servers or cloud services, to support the model. Once integrated, the model needs
                 to be able to process new data and provide predictions. Monitoring tools are established to track the model’s
                 performance and ensure it works correctly. Logging and reporting are also important to capture data on how

                 functional and useful for end-users.
                 Deployment of an  AI project  is an  essential phase  in bringing  the  created  AI solution into  practical  use.  The
                 following are some of the primary reasons why AI project deployment is relevant:

                    • Deployment converts theoretical models  into actual  tools that  are capable of being used in real-world
                   circumstances, bringing the AI solution into practice.

                    • By deploying the AI solution, organisations may assess its success, productivity, and relevance in real-world
                   scenarios.
                    • Deployment is required for end users to communicate with the AI solution.
                    • Deployment enables the AI solution to grow and be implemented in a variety of situations or places.
                    • Deployed AI solutions  can provide considerable social and financial advantages by increasing productivity,
                   lowering costs, and efficiently tackling crucial concerns.

                 The deployment process for AI models involves several key steps:
                 1.  Validating and testing the AI model: This phase ensures the performance of the AI model in real-world
                    situations that meet the expectations. This involves evaluating the accuracy, performance, and reliability of the
                    AI model.

                 2.  Integration with current systems: After testing and validating the AI model, it must be integrated with the
                    existing systems and infrastructure of the organisation by linking the AI model to data sources, APIs, and other
                    software systems.

                 3.  Monitoring  and  maintaining  the  deployed  AI  model:  After  deployment,  it is necessary  to  track  the
                    performance of the AI model to guarantee it remains effective. Monitoring and maintaining the deployed
                    AI model includes various tasks, such as evaluating its performance, identifying and fixing any errors, and
                    upgrading the model if required.
                 Some examples of successful AI projects that have been deployed in various industries include as self-driving cars,
                 medical diagnosis systems, and chatbots.

                 Case Study: Preventive Blindness
                 Problem: Prevent Loss of Vision and Delay in Report Generation

                 Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a severe complication of diabetes that affects the blood vessels in the retina. This
                 condition can lead to blurred vision and eventually blindness if not detected and treated promptly. Given that
                 approximately 537 million adults aged 20-79 are living with diabetes, addressing the timely detection of DR is
                 crucial. However, the lack of qualified doctors and delays in generating medical reports exacerbate the risk of
                 undiagnosed and untreated Diabetic Retinopathy.

                       AI Ethics


              Ethics are rules about what is right and wrong. AI ethics are rules about using artificial intelligence (AI) in a good
              way. As the use of AI increasing, companies are creating rules called AI codes of ethics.

              An AI code of ethics is a set of rules that says how AI should be used to help people. These rules allow people make
              good decisions when using AI.

              Some of the AI ethics that you need to follow while working on an AI model are:
                 • Model should be understandable by all.

                 • Every aspect of the model should be self-explanatory and transparent.
                 • Covering all the sections of the population is important.

                 • Countercheck and validate all the assumptions taken and the results.
                 • Keep a watch on the functioning and working of your system, as something can go wrong and timely detection
                 of the same is important.

                 • Also, fix the responsibility and set the accountability.

              Ethics and Personal Data

              Ethics play a crucial role in handling personal data, focusing on privacy, consent, transparency, and data security.
              Privacy  ensures that  individuals' personal information is respected and  protected,  requiring  organisations to
              collect, use, share, and process data in ways that maintain confidentiality. Consent involves obtaining clear and
              explicit permission from individuals before collecting, sharing, processing, or using their data, ensuring they are
              informed about how their data will be used and giving them the option to withdraw consent. Transparency means
              being open about data collection practices, clearly communicating what data is collected, how it is used, stored
              and analysed, and who it is shared with. Data security involves implementing strong measures to protect personal
              data from unauthorised access, breaches, and other threats, ensuring the integrity and safety of the information.
              These ethical principles help build trust and ensure responsible data management.


              What are the Principles of AI Ethics?

              Ethics in AI encompasses the moral principles, values, and guidelines that govern the development, deployment,
              and use of artificial intelligence systems.

                    • Human rights: This principle emphasises that AI solutions should respect, protect, and uphold fundamental
                   human rights. This includes rights such as privacy, freedom of expression, freedom from discrimination, and the
                   right to a fair trial. AI systems should be designed and implemented in a way that they do not infringe upon
                   these rights and should be held accountable if they do.

                    • Bias: Bias in AI refers to the unfair or unjust treatment of individuals or groups based on characteristics such
                   as race, gender, age, or socioeconomic status. Bias can be unintentionally introduced into AI systems through
                   biased training data, flawed algorithms, or skewed decision-making processes. Addressing bias in AI involves
                   identifying, mitigating, and preventing bias at every stage of the AI development lifecycle, from data collection
                   and preprocessing to model training and deployment.
                    • Privacy: Privacy concerns the protection of individuals' personal data and their right to control how that data
                   is collected,  used, and  shared.  AI systems often rely on vast amounts of data, which  may include sensitive
                   information about individuals. It is essential to implement robust privacy measures, such as data anonymisation,
                   encryption, and user consent mechanisms, to ensure that AI solutions respect individuals' privacy rights and
                   comply with relevant data protection regulations.
                    • Inclusion: Inclusion in AI refers to ensuring that AI solutions are accessible, equitable, and beneficial for all
                   members of society, regardless of factors, such as race, gender, disability, or socioeconomic status. This involves
                   considering the diverse needs, perspectives, and experiences of different user groups throughout the design,
                   development, and deployment of AI systems. Inclusive AI design aims to prevent the exacerbation of existing
                   inequalities and to promote equal opportunities and outcomes for all individuals.

                 By adhering to these AI ethics principles, developers and organisations can contribute to the creation of AI solutions
                 that are not only technically robust but also ethically sound, socially responsible, and aligned with the values and
                 interests of society.

              crowd. You are being followed and recorded everywhere without information. Apple’s iPhone X used an advanced
              front-facing camera and machine learning to create a 3-dimensional map of a face for Face Id recognition. The
              company claimed that it is programmed to work without errors even for cosmetic changes. But within a few days
              of its launch, a Vietnam-based security firm-Bkav could unlock the Face ID using 3D-printed masks.


              What if AI Makes Mistakes

              Yes, it's true, AI can make mistakes. It's recorded that in 2016, when the Uber company conducted a test on self-
              driving cars in San Francisco, Uber’s autonomous vehicle ran six red lights. The situation got out of hand, but a
              licenced driver was made to sit behind the wheel in case of emergency so he took over control of the situation
              immediately. In another situation in the same year, Microsoft’s chatbot, Tay was released on Twitter. It is based
              on machine learning, natural language processing and social networks. It learnt its language from the people on
              Twitter over time that enabled it to have a meaningful conversation based on a topic. But sadly, it was taken offline
              within 16 hours of its launch as it started tweeting randomly some abusive and offensive content.


              Autonomous Weapons

              They are also known as killer robots. They can aim independently by pre-programmed instructions. Most of the
              technically advanced countries are developing these autonomous weapons to safeguard themselves. There are
              many dangers in using these weapons.


              Black Box Problem

              This problem is more associated with the neural networking of AI than simple machine learning algorithms. The
              system uses a huge data bank to learn and produce results. There is no way to understand how the system is
              working, what exactly the algorithm is doing and what method it is using during the process. Since there is no
              insight, it is called a Black Box problem. This happens because the data that the AI system is working on, goes
              through a lot of neural nodes which mutates it, making it extremely difficult to determine the working and the
              source of the problem.

                 AI Bias
                 Can we trust AI systems? Not yet. AI technology may inherit human biases due to biases in training data. Consider
                 the following examples:

                 Example 1:  Why do most images that show up when you do an image search for “doctor” depict white men?
                 Example 2: Why do most images that show up when you do an image search for “shirts” depict men's shirts?

                 Example 3: Why do most search results show "women’s salons" when you search for salons nearby?

                 Example 4: Why do virtual assistants often have female voices?
                 “AI bias is a phenomenon that occurs when an algorithm produces results that are systematically prejudiced towards
                 certain gender, language, race, wealth, etc., and therefore, produces skewed or learned output. Algorithms can have
                 built-in biases because they are created by individuals who have conscious or unconscious preferences that may go
                 undiscovered until the algorithms are used publicly."


                 What are the Sources of AI Bias?

                 Some of the sources of AI bias are:
                    • Data: AI systems are the result of the data that is fed into them. The data used to train the AI system is the first
                   step to check for biasness. The dataset for AI systems should be realistic and need to be of a sufficient size.
                   However, the largest data collected from the real world may also reflect human subjectivity and underlying social
                   biases. The Amazon AI recruitment system is a good example. It was found that their recruitment system was
                   not selecting candidates in a gender-neutral way. The machine learning algorithm was based on the number
                   of resumes submitted over a period of 10 years and most of them were men, so it favoured men over women.

                    • Algorithms: The algorithms themselves do not add bias to an AI model, but they can amplify existing biases. Let's
                   look at an example of an image classifier model trained on images in the public domain—pictures of people's
                   kitchens. It so happens that most of the images are of women rather than men. AI algorithms are designed to
                   maximise accuracy. Therefore, an AI algorithm may decide that the people in the kitchen are women, despite
                   some of the images being of men.
                                                                         AI Reflection, Project Cycle and Ethics  225]]></page><page Index="228"><![CDATA[• Developers: The last source of AI bias is developers. Those who design AI models focus on achieving the
                desired goals. On that path at times, the biases of the developers are reflected in their models. It's important to
                note here that ethics and AI bias are not the problems of the machines but of the humans behind the machines.


              AI Access
              AI access can be acquired by two means:

                 • Data availability: AI needs access to huge data sets so that it can analyse, draw conclusions, and learn from
                them.
                 • Abilities: AI needs access to capable hardware to turn its learning into useful action. Self-driven cars are
                examples of AI with right access.

              AI is used on bigger, faster and more expensive machines. AI is a privilege that only a few people can afford and
              take advantage of this new technology. This has created a gap between these two classes of people and it gets
              widened with the rapid advancement of technology.


              Difference between Ethics and Morals
              Ethics  and  morals  are  related  concepts  often  used  interchangeably,  but  they  have  distinct meanings and
              applications. The word ethics originated from the Greek word ethos. The meaning of ethos is character. The word
              morals originated from the Latin word mos. The meaning of Mos is custom.

              A.  Short answer type questions:
                  1.  What is INDIAai?
                Ans.  INDIAai is the National AI Portal of India. It is a central hub for everything related to AI in India. It is a joint
                    initiative of MeitY, NeGD and NASSCOM.

                  2.  What is the reason for big companies establishing their AI labs in India?
                Ans.  The favourable ecosystem, economy and the vast pool of talent in India have brought many big companies of the
                    world like Google, Microsoft, IBM, etc. to set up their research centres and AI labs in India.

                  3.  Name three different Domains of AI?
                Ans.  The three different Domains of AI are:
                    •  Data Statistics
                    •  Natural Language Processing
                    •  Computer Vision
                  4.  What is Natural Language Processing?
                Ans.  NLP is the ability of machines to read, understand and analyse meaning from human language.
                  5.  What is the concept of computer vision?
                Ans.  Computer vision is used to train computers to read, process and analyse visual data in the same way as humans do.

                  6.  Define the term confusion matrix.
                Ans.  Confusion matrix is a tabular structure that helps in measuring the performance of an AI model using the test data.
                  7.  How does AI help in the agriculture field?

                Ans.  AI can help farmers to get more from the land, and use resources more sustainably. Blue River Technology developed
                    a robot called See & Spray, which uses computer vision and image recognition software to monitor and precisely spray
                    pesticide on cotton plants. Plantix mobile app uses AI-powered image recognition software to help farmers to detect
                    plant diseases.
                  8.  What do you understand by the evaluation stage of the AI project cycle?

                Ans.  Evaluation is a process that critically examines a program. It involves collecting and analysing information about a
                    program's activities, characteristics, and outcomes. Its purpose is to make judgments about a program, to improve its
                    effectiveness, and/or to inform programming decisions.

                  9.  What is the black box problem?
                Ans.  The system uses a huge data bank to learn and produce results. There is no way to understand how the system is
                    working, what exactly the algorithm is doing, and what method it is using during the process. Since there is no insight,
                    it is called a black box problem. This happens because the data that the AI system is working on, goes through a lot of
                    neural nodes which mutates it, making it extremely difficult to determine the working and the source of the problem.
                 10.  List the categories in which the AI systems are classified.
                Ans.  AI can be classified into three categories:
                    •  Weak AI
                    •  Strong AI
                    •  Super AI
                 11.  Why is data considered an important source of AI bias?
                Ans.  The dataset for AI systems should be realistic and need to be of a sufficient size. However, the largest data collected
                    from the real world may also reflect human subjectivity and underlying social biases.

                   Ans.  AI is a powerful tool. It can be used in ways that can affect the society—positively or negatively. Like electricity or
                       nuclear energy, a lot depends on us—how we utilise AI for humanity.

                 B.  Long answer type questions:

                    1.  Explain any three world famous AI machines.
                   Ans.  The three AI machines are:
                       •  IBM Watson: It is a question-answering machine that combines artificial intelligence (AI) and sophisticated analytical
                         software. It answers the questions posed in natural languages. Companies use it for analysing the data, predicting
                         future growth prospects and automating some tedious and complex processes.
                       •  Google’s Driverless car: Google launched its Waymo division to design, manufacture and market driverless vehicles
                         around the world. These cars are AI-enabled.
                       •  Sophia, the Humanoid Robot: It was designed by Hong Kong-based company Hanson Robotics in Feb 2016 and
                         made her first public appearance in March 2016 in the USA.

                    2.  List down the advantages of AI.
                   Ans.  The following are the advantages of AI:
                       •  Increased automation: AI can be used to automate anything, ranging from tedious tasks to the process of recruitment
                         of employees. There are AI-based applications that can be used for the hiring of new recruits. Mya, is an AI app that
                         automates tedious parts of the recruitment process such as sourcing, screening, and scheduling.
                       •  Increased productivity: AI is widely used in businesses. It is used to manage highly computational tasks that require
                         maximum effort and time. Starting from staff recruitment to automated packing of products, AI has the potential to
                         increase productivity.
                       •  Smart decision-making: AI helps in making smart decisions. Salesforce Einstein Analytics is a comprehensive AI for
                         CRM (Customer Relationship Management), designed to enable companies to make smarter business decisions. The
                         goal of this technology is to give sales and marketing departments more comprehensive customer behaviour and
                         sales prospects.
                       •  Solve  complex  problems: AI is being used to solve complex problems that cannot be solved by human
                         beings. Through the years, AI has progressed from simple machine learning algorithms to advanced machine
                         learning concepts that have helped resolve complex problems like fraud detection, medical diagnosis, weather
                         forecasting, and so on.
                       •  Strengthens economy: AI is estimated to contribute $15 trillion to the world's economy by 2030. It is estimated that
                         the greatest impact of AI will be in the fields of healthcare and robotics. The rise in the economy will mainly be from
                         the substitution of work by automation and increased innovation in products and services.

                    3.  Give three examples of AI around us.
                   Ans.  The three examples of AI around us are as follows:
                       •  Smartphones:  The  built-in  smart  assistants  (like  Siri)  are  some  obvious  examples  of  AI.  Google’s  AI-powered
                         predictions have a visible impact in every person’s life. The portrait mode of the camera on our smartphone is also
                         an AI feature. It makes the background blur while focusing on the foreground object.
                       •  Email spam filters: Email categorisation and spam filters are some of the powerful features of AI that affect our inbox.
                         Simple rule-based filters are used to mark spam or put email into various categories as Primary, Social, Promotion
                         or Important.
                       •  Virtual assistants: Smart virtual assistants that we use to control our smart house are prime examples of AI impacting
                         our daily lives. They use AI to study our behaviour and patterns so, that they can adjust themselves automatically.
                         They are capable to do several things like sending quick messages, setting reminders, checking the weather and
                         getting the latest news.




                                                                         AI Reflection, Project Cycle and Ethics  233]]></page><page Index="236"><![CDATA[4.  How can a machine become intelligent?
                Ans.  Artificial Intelligence makes the machines intelligent. Programming along with some aspects of human intelligence
                    like decision-making and problem-solving gives rise to intelligent machines. Machines are fed with enough data and
                    correct algorithms to make them intelligent.
                  5.  “The more the data, the better will be the analysis” Justify.
                Ans.  AI requires large  amounts of data to find  the  latest trends and  patterns. For  example,  I plan  to organise a  social
                    gathering in an open air setup in the month of August in Delhi. I will have to look for a weather forecast for the same
                    and also look at the previous years' trends. So data collection is the base for analyses and pattern recognition models.
                    From  those patterns, predictive models  can be made. Applications of AI in data sciences  can be seen in weather
                    forecasting, score prediction, targeted advertisement, predictive analysis in finance.
                  6.  Explain the ethical issue related to problem selection.

                Ans.  When identifying an issue for an AI project, consider how it will influence individuals as well as society. These are some
                    important ethical issues:
                    •  Fairness: Make sure that the AI system does not unfairly favour a particular group above others.
                    •  Privacy: Ensure that the AI system protects the confidentiality of individuals and never collects or uses the private
                      data of individuals without their consent.
                    •  Transparency: People should know how exactly the AI system functions as well as why specific choices are made.
                    •  Social impact: Examine how the AI system may influence society as a whole, and how it might encourage biases or
                      cause of social divisions.
                    •  Environmental impact: Examine how AI systems could have negative impacts on the environment. For example,
                      consuming a lot of electricity or emitting pollutants.
                  7.  What is Data? Also, explain the types of data.

                Ans.  Data is a piece of raw information or facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis. They are raw facts
                    that need to be processed to get meaningful information. Whenever we want the AI project to be able to predict an
                    output, we need to train it with a data set first. Data plays an important part of an AI project as it creates the base on
                    which the AI project is built.

                     There are two types of data:
                    •  Training data: It is data on which we train our AI project model. It is basically to fit the parameters of the project for
                      the model. In training data, the output is available to the model.
                    •  Testing data: It is used to check the performance of an AI model. In testing data, the data is not seen for which the
                      predictions have to be made.
                  8.  What is the need for visualising data?

                Ans.  The needs for data visualisation are:
                    •  It simplifies the complex quantitative information.
                    •  It analyses and explores big data easily.
                    •  It identifies the areas for improvement.
                    •  It identifies the relationship between data points and variables.
                    •  It explores new patterns and reveals hidden patterns.

                  9.  What is the application of AI in healthcare?
                Ans.  For saving human lives, the medical industry is relying on AI on many fronts. Healthcare organisations are using IBM
                    Watson for medical diagnosis. Google’s DeepMind has successfully developed a system that can analyse retinal scans
                    and spot symptoms of sight-threatening eye diseases. AI is used in diagnostic centres to analyse samples of tissues and
                    provide accurate results.

                   Ans.  Following are the concerns related to AI:
                       •  Job Loss: With more machines being used for day-to-day work, the fear of unemployment is increasing.
                       •  Personal Privacy: The cameras installed use facial recognition to identify you in the crowd. You are being followed
                         and recorded everywhere without information.
                       •  AI can make mistakes: Microsoft’s chatbot-Tay and Uber using self-driven cars are some of the famous mistakes
                         made by AI.

                 C.  Competency-based/Application-based questions:                    #Experiential Learning

                    1.  If a person develops an AI algorithm, would his/her bias be reflected in the AI algorithm? For example, if an American
                       developer develops an AI algorithm that is trained for his accent only, is it not a bias for people with different accents?
                   Ans.  Yes, the biases of the developer of the AI algorithm can be reflected in the AI algorithm. For example, if an American
                       developer creates an AI algorithm trained primarily on American accents, it may perform poorly for people with different
                       accents. This is a bias in the algorithm as it fails to equally accommodate all users. A practical example of bias in AI can
                       be seen in search results; when searching for “Places to buy white formal shirts,” the algorithm might predominantly
                       show brands like Raymonds and Peter England that specialise in men's collections, potentially overlooking brands that
                       cater to women or unisex options.

                            Language Understanding (LUIS) is a cloud-based AI service from Microsoft Azure that interprets natural
                          language inputs. It identifies  user intents and extracts relevant information (entities) from the text,
                          enabling applications to understand and respond to user queries effectively. LUIS offers customisable
                          models, pre-built domains, and  continuous  learning  capabilities to improve accuracy  over  time. It
                          integrates seamlessly with other Azure services, facilitating the creation of intelligent bots and applications
                          for various use cases like customer service, virtual assistants, and home automation.

                         Data Pyramid and Its Different Stages


                 The data pyramid is a conceptual model that illustrates the hierarchical structure of data processing, depicting
                 the progressive transformation of raw data into actionable wisdom. It starts with raw data, which initially has
                 no use. Through processing and analysis, this data evolves into meaningful information, then knowledge, and
                 ultimately wisdom. This transformation enables informed decision-making and a deeper understanding of the
                 world around us.

              The DIKW pyramid represents the relationships between data, information, knowledge, and wisdom. Each building
              block is a step towards a higher level - first comes data, then is information, next is knowledge, and finally comes
              wisdom. Each step answers different questions about the initial data and adds value to it. Let's learn about them.
                 • Data (Base Level)
                    ✶ In this stage data is in its most basic form, unprocessed and unstructured.
                    ✶ It has no meaning and is not very useful in this form.
                 • Information
                    ✶ It is a processed data that collectively carries a logical meaning.
                    ✶  It is obtained by analysing raw data to make it easier to measure, visualise, and analyse for decision-making.
                    ✶  By asking relevant questions about 'who', 'what', 'when', 'where', etc., we can derive valuable information from
                   the data and make it more useful for us.
                 • Knowledge
                    ✶ It is useful information that leads to a deeper understanding.
                    ✶ It represents a more profound comprehension of how things happen.
                    ✶ It is the ability to use information to achieve desired output.
                 • Wisdom (Top Level)
                    ✶ It represents the highest level of understanding. Wisdom is knowledge applied in action.
                    ✶ It is the ability to understand why things are happening in a particular way.
                    ✶ It involves critical thinking to interpret data and make good consistent decisions.
              Let's understand data pyramid with a simple "Traffic Light" example:

                         How to Become Data Literate?


                 Data literate is a person who can interact with data to understand the world around them and derive meaningful
                 information from data. Some key points that will help you become a data literate are as follows:

                    • Data identification and sourcing: Identify the source of data to find whether the data is reliable or not.
                    • Understand the basics: Learn the concepts of data, types of data, and how it can be used as not all data is
                   suitable for every kind of analysis.

                    •  Learn data analysis tools: There are many data analysis apps available that can be learned in order to understand
                   the impact of the right data. Analysis involves using statistical tools or software to interpret the data. This can
                   include calculating simple averages for more complex tasks.
                    • Gain statistical knowledge: Statistics play a vital role in data literacy. It's one of the vital components that must
                   be learned before you dive into the data-driven world.
                    •  Use data visualisation: Understand the techniques of data visualisation graphics, and charts. Tools like tableau,
                   matplotlib, and python can be used effectively.

                    •  Learn data manipulation: Understanding how to manipulate data to meet the requirements is also one of the
                   key factors. Methods like filtering, sorting, grouping, and omitting are essential for extracting insights from large
                   dataset.
                    •  Practise data cleaning: Learning to remove data redundancy and data inaccuracy is essential to being data
                   literate. This may include dealing with missing values, removing outliers, or transforming data into a format
                   suitable for analysis.

                 Plan

                 Planning sets a clear roadmap and structured approach to enhance data
                 literacy across different levels of awareness. You can:

                 ●   define the specific and measurable goals.
                 ●   develop a timeline and milestones for achieving these goals.

                 ●   identify and allocate resources needed (e.g., budget, tools, personnel).


                                                       Communication
                                                       Clear and consistent communication about data literacy  will ensure an
                                                       efficient data literacy framework within an organisation. This involves:

                                                       ●   designing  a  well-formulated  communication  plan  to  explain  the

                 ●   monitoring continuously the effectiveness of communication efforts and make adjustments as needed. It will
                    help in minimising the risk of any associated costs.

                 Assess

                 Introducing participants to data literacy assessment tools and finding
                 out  how  comfortable  they  are  with  data  is  crucial  in  data  literacy

              Prescriptive Learning

              Prescriptive learning refers to an educational approach that focuses
              on  guiding  students  towards  specific  outcomes  or  behaviours
              through structured instruction and targeted interventions based on
              data and analysis of their learning needs.
              By implementing a prescriptive learning approach, organisations can
              provide a set of diverse resources that align with individual learning
              styles. This approach ensures that there is:
              ●   customised  learning  journeys  tailored  according  to  different  people(  for  example,  different  educational
                  backgrounds) based on individual needs and preferences.
              ●   a variety of learning materials that cater to different learning styles and help in easier grasping of concepts.
              ●   enough leverage or advantage to the learners to progress at their own pace, accommodating their schedules
                  and learning speeds.
              ●   create  an  environment  that  makes  learners  feel  comfortable  and  gain  new  skills  in  an  environment  to
                  supports continuous learning and encourages self-directed exploration.

              ●   each participant can choose the materials and methods that work best for them, leading to more effective
                  learning and greater improvement in data literacy skills over time.

                                                      Designing an evaluation metric for the data literacy program involves
                                                      creating a structured framework to assess participants’ progress and
                                                      the effectiveness of the program overall. It helps to:

                                                      ●  improve participants’ overall data literacy skills.

                         Data Security and Privacy

                 The terms data security and data privacy are often used interchangeably, but they mean different things. Data privacy
                 determines who can access the data, while data security involves tools and policies to restrict access to the data.


                             Data Privacy               It is governing how data is collected, shared, and used.



                            Data Security               It is protecting data from attackers who might want to misuse it.



                 What is Data Privacy?
                 Data  privacy  referred  to  as information privacy  is  concerned  with  the  proper  handling,  processing,  storage,
                 and usage  of sensitive data including personal data and other confidential data, such as certain financial data
                 and intellectual property data, to meet regulatory requirements as well as protecting the confidentiality and
                 immutability of the data.
                 So, when we talk of data privacy, it is expected that any platform or individuals who have access to this information
                 ensure that data is used in a way that respects and fulfils legal requirements and compliance of handling privacy
                 rights. These include how the data is collected and shared for usage and who all have access to data.

                                                                                                Data Literacy   257]]></page><page Index="260"><![CDATA[Given below are two examples which may compromise our data privacy.

              Why is Data Privacy Important?

              Data privacy is important because:
              ●  a data breach at a government agency can put top secret information in the hands of an enemy country.
              ●  a data breach at a hospital can put personal health information in the hands of those who might misuse it.
              ●  a data breach at a corporation can cause put proprietary data in the hands of a competitor.
              ●   a data breach at a school can inconvenience to the parents, by getting continuous calls from tuition and
                  coaching centers cause annoyance and stress.
              The following best practices can help you ensure data privacy:

              ●  Understanding what data you have collected, how it is handled, processed, used, and where it is stored.
              ●  Only necessary data required for a project should be collected.
              ●  User consent while data collection must be of utmost importance.

              What is Data Security?

              Data security involves safeguarding digital information from unauthorised access, corruption, or theft throughout
              its entire lifecycle. Essentially, security means protecting anything from theft and misuse. Data security is related
              to securing sensitive data. It aims to prevent unauthorised access, theft, or corruption of data, regardless of
              whether  the  data  is  personal  or  not.  Systems  and  networks  must  be  established  to  prevent  malicious  and
              fraudulent activities from harming, destroying, misusing, or stealing crucial digital data.


                                                  Why is Data Security Important?
                                                  Cyber  attacks  are  becoming  more  frequent  as  a  result  of  the  growing
                                                  volume of data stored in the cloud. The best course of action given the
                                                  volume of traffic being produced is to regulate and secure the transmission
                                                  of private or sensitive data everywhere, that it is known to exist. Avoid
                                                  entering  sensitive  information,  such  as  your  address,  PAN,  or  Aadhar
                                                  number on unrecognised and unsafe websites.
                                                  The most possible reasons why data security is more important now are:
              ●  A constant fear cyberattacks affect all people.
              ●  The fast-technological changes will boom cyberattacks.
              ●  A persistent fear everyone is impacted by cyberattacks.
              ●   Rapid technical advancements will increase the frequency of cyberattacks.

                 Different types of data security controls are as follows:
                 ●   Strong Passwords:  A  strong  password  is  a  combination  of  atleast  8
                    characters  with  upper  and  lower-case  letters,  numbers,  and  special
                    characters  that  is  difficult  for  unauthorised  individuals  or  automated
                    programs to guess or crack. It is a very basic step that one should take
                    and never share the same with even the most trusted ones. Avoid using
                    birth dates, anniversary dates, and common combinations of numbers.
                    Some examples of strong passwords are:  m#P52s@ap$V, "N4&vQ2! p".



                                                ●   Authentication: It also refers to multi-factor authentication (MFA) and is
                                                   an additional security layer in online data systems. After a user enters their
                                                   password to log in, MFA requires them to provide one or more additional
                                                   forms  of  authentication  to  verify  their  identity.  This  could  include  one-
                                                   time generated code as a security token in smartphones or emails or a
                                                   fingerprint or facial recognition, or Passwords or PINs.



                 ●   Access Controls: Access controls refer to the security measures and protocols to
                    restrict  access  to  sensitive  data,  ensuring  that  only  authorised  individuals  or
                    entities can view, modify, or interact with it. This reduces the risk of unauthorised
                    access by limiting the number of users who can interact with sensitive data.



                                                ●   Data Backup: Data backup refers to the process of creating copies of data
                                                   to ensure that it can be restored in the event of data loss due to natural
                                                   disasters, accidents, cyber-attacks, or other unexpected events. Sometimes
                                                   physical backup media is used to secure in access-controlled environments.
                                                   Another method to secure data can be the cloud backup which is considered
                                                   more reliable.


                 ●   Encryption:  Encryption  is  a  security  technique  that  transforms  readable
                    data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) using an algorithm
                    and an encryption key. This process ensures that only authorised individuals
                    with the correct decryption key can access the original data. Encrypted data
                    is meaningless if captured by attackers.



                                           ●   Data Disposal:  Data  disposal  refers  to  the  process  of  securely  destroying
                                               or  deleting  data  that  is  no  longer  needed  to  prevent  unauthorised  access,
                                               recovery, and misuse. Proper data disposal practices are essential to ensure that

              Data security and data privacy are crucial components of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

              Data Security in AI
              AI systems often rely on vast amounts of data for training and operation. Unauthorised access and tampering
              could lead to inaccurate AI models and compromised outcomes. Many AI applications process sensitive data,
              such as personal, financial, or health-related information. Strong data security measures can stop data breaches
              and unauthorised access.

                       Acquiring, Processing, and Interpreting Data

              Working with data involves three key steps: acquiring, processing, and interpreting. First, gather data from
              sources like surveys and databases. Next, process it by cleaning and organising it for accuracy. Finally, analyse
              the data to find patterns and insights that help make informed decisions.


              Types of Data

              In statistics, various types of data are gathered, analysed, interpreted, and presented. These data consist of
              individual factual pieces recorded for analysis. Data analysis involves interpretation and presentation, producing
              statistics to get some meaningful insight from that data. Data classification and handling are crucial processes
              that use multiple tags and labels to define data, ensuring its integrity and confidentiality. Artificial Intelligence is
              crucial, with data serving as its foundation. We come across different types of data and information every day.

                 Textual Data (Qualitative Data)

                 Textual data is the information that is written or expressed using words and language. It includes things like
                 articles, books, emails, messages, and any other written content. Instead of numbers, it's made up of letters,
                 words, and sentences that convey meaning and information. Qualitative data is also called categorical data.
                 For example, "Learning AI is fun."

                 Qualitative data is further classified into two types that includes,
                    • Nominal data
                    • Ordinal data



                 Nominal Data
                 It consists of categories or names that cannot be ordered or ranked. Nominal data is often used to categorize
                 observations into groups, and the groups are not comparable.  Examples of nominal data include gender (Male
                 or Female), and blood type (A, B, AB, O).


                 Ordinal Data
                 It consists of categories that can be ordered or ranked.  Ordinal data is often used to measure  opinions, where
                 there is a natural order to the responses. Examples of ordinal data include education level (Elementary, Middle,
                 High School, College), job position (Manager, Supervisor, Employee), etc.


                 Numeric Data (Quantitative Data)

                 Numeric data means information that's in numbers, not words or descriptions. It's often called quantitative data
                 because it's collected as numbers and can be used for math and stats. For instance, if you know the total number
                 of workers and how many are men, you can figure out how many are women by subtracting. This ability to do
                 calculations with numeric data makes it great for doing statistics and analysing data.
                 For example, marks, temperature, height, weight, etc.

              AI Domains and Type of Data
              Various types of data are utilised across different domains to train models, make predictions, and generate
              insights. Here are the types of data commonly used in three key domains of AI:


              Natural Language Processing (NLP)

                Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Computer Science and a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that aims
              to make computers understand human language. It's all about teaching, and training computers to understand
              and work with human language. Types of data used in NLP are:
              ●   Textual data: This includes a wide range of written text, such as articles, books, emails, social media posts,
                  web content, PDF files, etc.

              ●   Audio data: Audio recordings of spoken language, which are transcribed into textual data.

              Computer Vision

                Computer Vision is  a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses machine learning and neural networks to teach
              computers to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs. It is like giving
              eyes to computers. It helps them look at pictures and videos from the real world and understand what they’re
              seeing. With Computer Vision, computers can figure out what’s in a picture or video, just like we do. They can
              recognise objects, people, and even actions happening in videos.

              Data acquisition, also known as acquiring data, refers to the procedure of gathering data like raw facts, figures or
              statistics from relevant sources either for reference or for analysis needed in AI projects. This involves searching

              for datasets suitable for training AI models. The process typically comprises three key steps and plays a crucial
              role in obtaining and preparing data for analysis.

              For example, to collect data for making a CV model for a self-driving car.

              The three key steps involved in data acquisition are given below:

              Step 1: Data Discovery
              Data discovery is about hunting for valuable information in different places, checking if it’s good quality, and
              making sense of what we find. In the above example:

              ●  We will require pictures of roads and the objects on roads.
              ●  We can search and download this data from the Internet.
















                                                                                                    Human Being

                                                                                                    Lamp post

                                                                                                    Trees

                                                                                                    Cars

                 Data augmentation is the process of increasing the
                 amount  and  diversity  of  data.  We  do  not  collect
                 new  data,  rather  we  transform  the  already  present
                 data.  Data  augmentation  means  increasing  the
                 amount  of  data  by  adding  copies  of  existing  data
                 with small changes. The image given here does not
                 change, but we get data on the image by changing
                 different parameters like colour, rotation, flipping and
                 brightness. New data is added by slightly changing
                 the existing data.

                 In the above example:
                 ●  We apply flipping and rotation transformation to create variations of the original images.

                 ●   We also simulate occlusions such as objects partially blocking the view to train the model to handle obstructed
                    scenarios.
                 Step 3: Data Generation

                 Data generation refers to generating or recording data using sensors. Recording temperature readings of a building
                 is an example of data generation. Recorded data is stored in a computer in a suitable form.














                 In the above example, of self-driving car. Data acquisition is done for creating fake driving scenarios with different
                 road conditions, traffic patterns, weather, and lighting to cover many possible situations.

              Data can be acquired from various sources, classified as either primary or secondary.


              Primary Data Sources
              The data generated from the experiment is an example of primary data. Some of the sources for primary data
              include surveys, interviews, experiments, etc. Here is an Excel sheet showing the data collected for students of a class.















              Secondary Data Sources

              Secondary data sources are the external sources for collecting data, rather than generating it personally. Some sources
              for secondary data collection are: Published Literature, Government Publications, Market research reports, etc.

                                                                                           •   UCI is a collection of

              Best Practices for Acquiring Data
              Acquiring data effectively is crucial for ensuring its accuracy, reliability, and usability. Here are some best practices
              for acquiring data:
              1.   Set Clear Goals: Understand why you need the data and what you want to achieve; specify the type, format,
                  and detail level required.

              2.   Identify Data Sources: Use primary data that you collect yourself (surveys, interviews) and secondary data
                  from others (reports, databases).

              3.   Evaluate  Sources:  Ensure  data  sources  are  trustworthy,  relevant,  accurate,  and  current;  get  necessary
                  permissions and respect privacy.
              4.   Collect and Prepare Data: Use surveys, interviews, sensors, and web scraping; clean data by fixing errors,
                  removing duplicates, and anonymising.

              5.   Validate, Document, and Store: Cross-check and sample for accuracy, keep detailed records and meta-
                  data, store data securely, and regularly update it while following laws and regulations.

                 Data Acquisition from Websites
                 The process of collecting data from websites using software is called Data Scraping. It is a common method for
                 extracting information from websites. It is commonly known as Web Scraping.

                 Just like you might copy text from a book or from your friend, data scraping involves copying information from
                 websites. But instead of doing it manually, we use special tools or programs to do it automatically. These tools
                 can navigate websites, find the information we want, and copy it into the required format.

                 We scrape websites to get data needed for different reasons. It can be collecting prices for market research,
                 news articles for analysis, or customer reviews for a product.

                 While web scraping is not illegal, using data without permission is illegal. Think of web scraping like picking fruit
                 from someone else’s garden without their permission and it is also about what you do with the fruit afterwards

                 Using data with permission is legal and ethical, just like getting permission from the owner of garden to take
                 fruit. It’s all about respecting the rights of the website owner and following the rules.


                 Ethical Concerns in Data Acquisition
                 While gathering data and choosing datasets, certain ethical issues can be addressed before they occur:


                                        Bias         Take steps to understand and avoid any preferences
                                                     or partiality in data



                                      Consent        Take necessary permissions before collecting or
                                                     using an individual's data



                                   Transparency      Explain how you intend to use the collected data and
                                                     do not hide intentions

              Data is indeed a collection of information gathered through various means such as observations, measurements,
              research, surveys or analysis. This information can include a wide range of elements like facts, numbers, names,
              figures, or descriptions of things. To make data easier to understand and analyse, it is often organised into
              formats such as graphs, charts, or tables.


              Usability of Data
              Let's take an example of completing a school project. You need clear instructions, a neat workspace, and accurate
              information.  Similarly,  using  data  effectively  relies  on  its  clarity,  organisation,  and  accuracy.  There  are  three
              primary factors determining the usability of data:
              1.   Structure of Data: Defines how data is stored. Data needs to have a clear structure. It should be organised
                  in a way that makes sense so that it can be used effectively.
                   Like when your mother starts cooking your favourite food she ensures before cooking that all ingredients
                  are available and are put in order for smooth and organised cooking. For example,

                   Marks of a students arranged in a spreadsheet.








                                                                           Rohit Rawat a student with ID 10187
                                                                             of Class 12 Section D has scored
                                                                                          72%.




                                Spreadsheet – Good structure                 Text document – Poor structure
                        Data is stored in a sheet with the details of each   Data is stored in a text document
                          individual stored according to a set of rules.     with no set of organising rules.

              2.   Cleanliness:  Clean data should not have duplicates, missing values, outliers, and other anomalies so that
                  its reliability and usefulness for analysis is not affected. In the given example, cleaning of data removes the
                  duplicate values.


















              3.   Accuracy: Accuracy is same as reliability so it indicates how well the data matches real-world values. Accurate
                  data closely reflects actual values without errors, enhancing the quality and trustworthiness of the dataset.
                  When your measurement is accurate, it makes your data really good. It’s like having a gold star on your
                  homework—it shows you did a great job!

                 Features of Data
                 Data features are also called the characteristics or properties of the data. They describe each piece of information
                 in a dataset. They define what each data point represents and help us make sense of the data. For example,
                 ●   In a table of student records, features could include things like the student’s name, age, or grade.
                 ●   In a photo dataset, features might include properties like the colour present in each image, the resolution,
                    brightness, or the presence of certain objects.

                 These features help us understand and analyse the data. In AI models, we need two types of features: Independent
                 and Dependent.

                 Independent

                 Independent variables (sometimes called predictor variables) are those that are used to generate predictions
                 about or to account for the variation in the dependent variable (the goal). These features are the input to the
                 model—they’re the information we provide to make predictions.


                 Dependent
                 The dependent variable is the variable about which predictions or explanations are being sought. These features
                 are  the  outputs  or  results  of  the  model—they’re  what  we’re  trying  to  predict.  For  example,  imagine  we’re
                 building an AI model to predict students’ final exam grades based on various factors.



                                                                                                Data Literacy   271]]></page><page Index="274"><![CDATA[The independent features would include:
                 • Study hours: The number of hours a student spends studying.
                 • Attendance: Whether the student attended classes regularly or not.
                 • Previous grades: The grades the student received in previous exams.

                 • Extracurricular activities: Participation in extracurricular activities, such as sports or clubs.
              The dependent feature, in this case, would be:
                 • The final exam grade—the outcome or prediction that the model gives us.

              Together, they help us understand and improve student outcomes using AI-driven predictions.

                 • The independent variable is the cause. Its value is independent of other variables in your study.

                 • The dependent variable is the effect. Its value depends on changes in the independent variable.


              Data Preprocessing
              Data preprocessing is an essential phase in the machine learning process that prepares datasets for effective
              machine learning applications. It is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate
              records from a dataset. It includes multiple processes to clean, transform, reduce, integrate, and normalise data.

                                                                                   Data

                 Data Processing
                 Data processing involves tasks to refine raw data for analysis or application, including cleaning, organising,
                 transforming, and summarising information. It ensures data accuracy, relevance, and accessibility for effective
                 decision-making and analysis. It is crucial across various sectors like business, science, and technology, facilitating
                 better utilisation of data assets. Data processing helps computers understand raw data. Use of computers to
                 perform different operations on data is included under data processing.


                 Data Interpretation
                 Data interpretation is the process of making sense of data by analysing it to uncover patterns, trends, and
                 insights. It involves examining the data to understand its meaning, implications, and significance, helping to
                 inform decision-making and draw conclusions. It is the process of making sense out of data that has been
                 processed. The interpretation of data helps us answer critical questions.


                 Process of Data Interpretation
                 The steps in the process of data interpretation are as follows:


                           Acquire            Process            Analyse           Interpret           Present

                 1.   Acquire: This initial step involves gathering raw data from diverse sources such as surveys, databases, or
                    sensors. It ensures that all relevant information is collected to provide a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

                 2.   Process: Once the data is collected, it undergoes cleaning and organisation to remove errors, inconsistencies,
                    or irrelevant information. This step ensures that the data is in a standardised format and ready for further
                    analysis.

                 3.   Analyse:  In  this  phase,  the  cleaned  and  organised  data  is  scrutinised  to  identify  patterns,  correlations,
                    or  trends.  Statistical  methods,  algorithms,  or  data  visualisation  techniques  may  be  employed  to  extract
                    meaningful insights from the data.
                 4.   Interpret: After analysing the data, the results are interpreted to derive actionable insights or conclusions.
                    This involves understanding the implications of the analysis findings in the context of the problem or question
                    at hand.

                 5.   Present: The final step involves presenting the interpreted findings in a clear and engaging manner. This
                    could include visualisations such as tables, graphs or charts, along with concise summaries, to effectively
                    communicate the insights derived from the data analysis.

                 These steps make sure that working with data is organised, complete, and useful, so that organisations can make
                 smart choices based on the data.

              Quantitative Data Interpretation
              It is the process of analysing and understanding quantitative or numeric data. This type of data often comes
              from surveys, experiments, and numerical measurements. Quantitative data provides statistical insights and
              helps  in  identifying  patterns  and  trends.  It  requires  statistical  methods  and  techniques  like  mean,  median,
              standard deviation, etc. to interpret the data. The interpretation of quantitative data focuses on measurable
              outcomes and numerical relationships. It helps us answer questions like "when," "how many," and "how often".

              For example, (how many) numbers of likes on the Instagram post.

              Data Collection Methods in Quantitative Data Interpretation

              Data  collection  methods  in  quantitative  data  interpretation  involve  systematic  techniques  like  surveys  and
              experiments to gather numerical data. These approaches ensure data accuracy, facilitating reliable analysis and
              inference across various fields such as social sciences and healthcare.

















              Following are some application areas of quantitative data interpretation:

              ●  Interviews: Quantitative interviews play a key role in collecting information.

              ●    Polls: A poll is a type of survey that asks simple questions to respondents. Polls are usually limited to one
                  question.
              ●  Observations: Quantitative data can be collected through observations in a particular time period.
              ●  Longitudinal studies: A type of study conducted over a long time.

              ●  Survey: Surveys can be conducted for a large number of people to collect quantitative data.

                 The four steps involved in quantitative data analysis are:
                 1.   Relate measurement scales with variables: Understand the type of data you have and match it with the
                    appropriate measurement scale. For example, if you are looking at student grades, use ordinal (A, B, C) or
                    ratio (numeric scores) scales.

                 2.  Connect descriptive statistics with data: Use statistical measures to summarise and describe your data.
                     For example, if you have test scores for a class of students, calculate the mean score to know the average
                    performance, the median to understand the central tendency, and the standard deviation to see how varied
                    scores are.
                 3.   Decide a measurement scale: Choose the appropriate scale to measure your data based on the type of variable
                    and the level of detail required. For example, if you are measuring weight, use a ratio scale because weight can
                    be zero and can be measured precisely.

                 4.   Represent data in an appropriate format: Display your data in a way that makes it easy to understand and
                    interpret. For example, if you want to show the distribution of test scores in a class, you might use a histogram.
                    If you want to show the relationship between study hours and test scores, a scatter plot would be appropriate.

                 Qualitative Data Interpretation

                   It is the process of analysing and understanding non-numeric data. This type of data is unstructured and often
                 comes from interviews, surveys, observations, or textual content. Qualitative data tells us about the emotions
                 and feelings of people. Qualitative data interpretation is focused on insights and motivations of people.



                 Data Collection Methods in Qualitative Data Interpretation
                 Data collection methods in qualitative data interpretation involve techniques such as interviews and observations
                 to  gather  rich,  descriptive  data  for  detailed  analysis,  fostering  a  deeper  understanding  of  complex  human

                 experiences and behaviours. Some methods are as follows:
                    • Record keeping: This method utilises documents that are reliable and well curated and other similar sources of
                   information as the data source that are verified and maintained. It is similar to going to a library.

                    • Observation: In this method, data is collected by observing the participants, their behaviour and emotions,

                   carefully.
                    • Case studies: In this method, data is collected from case studies.

                    • Focus groups: In this method, data is collected after a group discussion on topics of relevance.

                    •  Longitudinal studies: In this data collection method, data is collected on the same data source repeatedly over
                   an extended period of time.

                    • One-to-one interviews: In this method, data is collected using a one-to-one interview.


                 Open Ended Surveys and Questionnaires
                 Open ended surveys and questionnaires allow organisations to collect views and opinions from respondents
                 without meeting in person.

              Steps to Qualitative Data Analysis

              The five steps involved in qualitative data analysis are:
              1.   Collect data: Gather qualitative data through various methods to understand people’s experiences, opinions,
                  or behaviours. This is done through interviews, surveys, observations, or documents. For example, a researcher
                  interviews patients about their experiences with a new healthcare app, recording their responses for further
                  analysis.
              2.   Organise and connect the qualitative data: Prepare and arrange the collected data in a systematic way
                  to make it easier to work with. For example, the researcher transcribes the recorded interviews into text
                  documents and organises them by participant or interview date.

                    themes, patterns, or categories. For example, the researcher reads through the interview transcripts and
                    highlights sections discussing "ease of use," "technical issues," and "benefits of the app," tagging them with
                    corresponding codes.
                 4.   Analyse your data for insights: Examine the coded data to identify deeper patterns, relationships, and
                    insights. For example, The researcher groups codes related to "ease of use" and "technical issues" into a
                    broader theme of "user experience" and analyses how these themes impact overall user satisfaction with the
                    app.

                 5.   Reporting on insights derived from analysis: Present the findings clearly, using quotes and visual aids to
                    support your conclusions and recommendations. For example, the researcher writes a report highlighting
                    the main themes along with positive and negative feedback.

              Textual DI

              Data  is  put  into  words,  like  in  a  paragraph,  which  works  well  for  small  amounts  of  data  that  can  be  easily
              understood.  But  for  larger  amounts,  this  type  of  presentation  may  not  be  the  best  because  it  can  get  too
              complicated. For instance, a paragraph might describe how a company's sales went up in the first quarter, and
              how many units of each product they sold, as well as improvements in customer satisfaction.


              Tabular DI

              Data is organised systematically in rows and columns within a table, facilitating structured representation. In the
              example given below, the title of the table, "Students, Marks Analysis," provides a descriptive overview of the
              table's content, summarising the analysis of student marks within the table.

              Graphical DI

              Some of the graphs include bar graphs, line graphs, pie charts, and scatter plots, which help in visualising trends,
              relationships, and distributions within the data.

                       Importance of Data Interpretation


              Data  interpretation  is  crucial  as  it  transforms  raw  data  into  actionable  insights,  guiding  informed  decision-
              making. By analysing and understanding data, organisations can uncover trends, patterns, and relationships,
              enabling them to optimise strategies, mitigate risks, and drive growth.


              Informed Decision Making
              A decision is only as good as the knowledge it is based on. It means when we analyse data, we get a clear picture
              of what’s going on. This helps us make decisions that are more likely to lead to success.

              For example, if the average height of students is known, the school can custom design the chairs and tables
              according to the requirements of the class.


              Reduced Cost
              Identifying needs can lead to a reduction in cost. It means by knowing what’s necessary, we can cut down on
              waste. We can use resources more efficiently and not spend money on things that aren’t important.

                 have bad reviews.

                 Identifying Needs
                 We can identify the needs of people by data interpretation. It means understanding what people want or require
                 by looking at the information we have.
                 For example, in a Pizza Shop, there are possibilities that Veg Farmhouse Pizza is a popular choice among the age
                 group 8-10 years old.


                         Using Tableau for Data Presentation


                 Using Tableau for data presentation involves connecting to various data sources, creating diverse visualisations,
                 and enabling interactive features. It supports sharing and collaboration, offers advanced analytics capabilities,
                 and promotes best practices for clear and effective data communication.


                 What is Tableau?
                 Tableau is a powerful data visualisation and business intelligence tool  for visualising and analysing data in order
                 to aid in business choices. It takes in data and produces various charts, graphs, maps, dashboards, and stories.

                     • Think about songs! Which songs do you like to listen to? Which songs do you love to sing?

                     • Do you have a favourite song, artist, album, or playlist?
                     • Let’s start thinking about the different aspects of a song, like instruments played and lyrics.
                     • Do your favourite songs have anything in common?

                     • Maybe your favourite music falls within the same genre.
                        ✶ A genre refers to the different styles of music.

                      factors. Methods like filtering, sorting, grouping, and omitting are essential for extracting insights from large data set.
                    •  Practise Cleaning: Learning to remove data redundancy and data inaccuracy is essential to be data literate.
                  3.  What are the steps involved in Data Acquisition?
                Ans.  The three key steps involved in Data Acquisition are as follows:
                    i.   Data discovery: It is about hunting for valuable information in different places, checking if it's good quality, and
                       making sense of what we find.
                    ii.   Data augmentation: It is the process of increasing the amount and diversity of data. We do not collect new data,
                       rather we transform the already present data. Data augmentation means increasing the amount of data by adding
                       copies of existing data with small changes.
                     iii.  Data generation: It refers to generating or recording data using sensors. Recording temperature readings of a
                       building is an example of data generation. Recorded data is stored in a computer in a suitable form.
                  4.  Explain the importance of having a clear structure in data and provide examples of good and poor data structure.
                Ans.   Clear structure in data ensures it is organised logically, facilitating efficient analysis and interpretation. For example,
                    marks of students arranged in a spreadsheet is a good structure, whereas a poor structure example if the student
                    records were stored in a disorganised manner, with inconsistent naming conventions or missing attributes, it would
                    impede data analysis and decision-making processes.
                  5.  Why is data privacy important?
                Ans.  It is important because:
                    •  A data breach at a government agency can put top secret information in the hands of an enemy state.
                    •  A breach at a hospital can put personal health information in the hands of those who might misuse it.
                    •  A breach at a corporation can put proprietary data in the hands of a competitor.
                    •   A breach at a school can cause inconvenience to the parents, such as constant calling from tuition and coaching
                      centers that leads to disturbance.
                  6.  Explain the term computer vision and the type of data used in this ?
                Ans.  Computer vision is like giving eyes to computers. It helps them look at pictures and videos from the real world and
                    understand what they're seeing. With Computer Vision, computers can figure out what's in a picture or video, just like
                    we do with our eyes. They can recognise objects, people, and even actions happening in videos.
                    Types of data used in computer vision include:
                    •  Image Data: Digital images captured by cameras or satellite imagery, and medical scans.
                    •  Video Data: Video data captured using camera, and surveillance footage.

              Mathematics is crucial to Artificial Intelligence (AI) because it provides the theoretical foundation and practical
              tools for developing, assessing, and optimising AI systems. It is the backbone of AI algorithms and models,
              empowering machines to process, analyse, and interpret vast amounts of data.
              In general, Mathematics  guarantees that AI models are precise, effective, and able to resolve challenging issues.


                       How are Math and AI related?

              Mathematics and AI are interconnected fields, with Mathematics supplying the theoretical foundations for many
              AI algorithms. Patterns are repeating designs or sequences that can be observed in numbers, shapes, images,
              languages, or objects in our surroundings. They follow a specific order or arrangement, making them easily
              recognisable. Mathematics aids in the study of these patterns. These patterns allow you to solve puzzles. They
              help identify an order or arrangement in lists of images or numbers. They are present everywhere around us.

              Patterns in Numbers
              Number patterns, often simply referred to as patterns, are sets of numbers that follow a specific order or rule.
              There are various types of number patterns, including Fibonacci, geometric, algebraic, and arithmetic patterns.
              Some tricks are given below for finding the patterns in numbers:

                 • Number Sequences: Look for a sequence where each number is related to the one before it in a specific way.
                This could be:
                ✶  Adding a constant value (e.g., 1, 4, 7, 10... +3 each time)
                ✶  Multiplying by a constant value (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16... x2 each time)

                ✶  Following a formula (e.g., 2n + 1: 3, 5, 7, 9...)
                 • Series: Analyse a series of numbers to identify the underlying rule for example square series, cube series, etc.
                 • Even or Odd: Is the sequence made of even numbers (2, 4, 6...) or odd numbers (1, 3, 5...)?
                 • Prime or Composite: Are the numbers prime (only divisible by 1 and itself) or composite (divisible by more
                than two numbers)?
                 • Fibonacci Sequence: This famous sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the
                two preceding numbers (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...).

                 Patterns in images refer to recurring visual elements or structures that can be recognised and analysed within
                 the context of an image. These patterns can be detected and utilised for various purposes, including image
                 recognition, classification, compression, and enhancement.
                    • Repeating shapes: Look for shapes that appear multiple
                   times in the image.
                   Are they of the same size and colour?
                   Do they form a larger shape?
                    • Symmetry: Does the image have a mirror effect where
                   one side reflects the other?
                   Is it symmetrical vertically, horizontally, or both?

                    • Colour patterns: Are there repeating colours or a specific
                   colour scheme used?
                   Do the colours alternate or follow a gradient?

                    • Progression: Do the elements in the image change in size, colour, or position in a predictable way?

                       Essential Mathematics for AI

              Math will help us to better understand AI and its way of working, but what kind of math is needed for AI?
              The kind of math needed for AI includes:
              1.   Probability and Statistics (exploring data): Probability theory and statistics are key fundamentals for many
                  AI algorithms, particularly those involving machine learning. It is useful in tasks such as natural language
                  processing, computer vision, and decision-making.
              2.   Linear Algebra (finding out unknown or missing values): Linear algebra is involved in large-scale data
                  processing playing a vital role in machine learning and AI. It performs operations in neural networks, image
                  processing, and data transformations.
              3.   Calculus (training and improving AI model): Calculus is essential for understanding the best possible
                  solution algorithms used in machine learning. It minimise mistakes and maximise the parameters of machine
                  learning models.
              4.  Graph Theory: Graph theory is used in AI representing trends using data visualisation.

                 6.   Logic and Set Theory: Logic and set theory are used in concepts like expert systems, database systems,
                    and knowledge graphs. Mathematics and AI are deeply integrated fields, with mathematics providing the
                    theoretical foundation for many AI algorithms and techniques.
                 7.   Algorithm design: The design of the algorithms often uses mathematical principles and structures such as
                    functions, matrices and graphs.


                         Statistics


                 Statistics is used for collecting, exploring, and analysing the data. It also helps in concluding data. It enables AI
                 systems to detect patterns, identify relationships, and infer conclusions from data.
                    • Data is collected from various sources.
                    • Data is explored and cleaned to be used.
                    • The analysis of data is done to understand it better.
                    • Conclusions and decisions can be made from the data.
                 Let’s consider an example to illustrate these steps:
                 A school wants to improve the performance of its students and decides to collect data on study habits and
                 grades.
                 •  Collecting Data:  The school conducts a survey where students report the number of hours they
                   study each week and their grades in various subjects.

                                •   Exploring and Cleaning Data: The school first looks at the data to find patterns, like the range
                                  of study hours and grades.
                                  They also clean the data by fixing any missing or incorrect information (e.g., if some students
                                  didn’t fill in all the fields or gave unrealistic answers).
                 •  Analysing Data: The school summarises the average study hours and grades to get an overview.

                   They also check if there is a significant relationship between study hours and grades.

                                •   Drawing Conclusions: The analysis might reveal that students who study for more hours tend
                                  to have higher grades. Based on this conclusion, the school might decide to implement study
                                  support programs to encourage students to study more.


                 Thus, we can say statistics helps in transforming the raw data into meaningful insights, enabling better decisions
                 and strategies in various fields such as business, healthcare, education, and more.

                         Application of Statistics


                 Statistics can be used in numerous fields because of its ability to extract meaningful insights from data and assist
                 in decision-making. Let us discuss some of the fields where statistics is used.

                         What is Probability in Statistics?


                 Probability is a branch of statistics that deals with the likelihood or chance of an event to happen or different
                 outcomes occurring in a given situation.
                    • It measures the amount of certainty of an event.
                    • It helps us make predictions about future events based on the data we have.
                    • It helps us understand how likely something is to happen.
                 The formula for probability is given as the ratio of the Number of Favourable Outcomes to the Total Number
                 of Possible Outcomes.
                                                        Number of Favourable Outcomes
                                                P(A) =
                                                       Total Number of Possible Outcomes
                 Where, P(A) - is probability of happening of an event (A)

                                                                           Maths for AI (Statistics & Probability)   303]]></page><page Index="306"><![CDATA[Let us understand it using the example of a coin.
              When a coin is tossed, there are two possible outcomes: head or tail.
              What is the probability of getting a head?
                                                                       1
                                                            P(Head) =
                                                                       2
                                                      1                                  1
              So, we see the chances of getting head is    and the chances of getting tail is   .
                                                      2                                  2
              Therefore, we conclude that when we toss a coin, there are equal chances of getting a head or a tail.

              Let us take another example, consider the probability of rolling a fair six-sided die.
              A fair six-sided die has six faces numbered from 1 to 6.
              The probability of rolling any specific number (say, 3) on a fair six-sided die is calculated as,
              Number of favourable outcomes (rolling a 3) = 1
              Total number of possible outcomes = 6 (since there are 6 faces on the die)
              So, the probability of rolling a 3 on a fair six-sided die is:
                                                    Number of Favourable Outcomes       1
                                           P(6) =                                    =
                                                  Total Number of Possible Outcomes     6

                 When discussing probability, we often rely on specific terms to describe the likelihood of events occurring. Let
                 us discuss the specific terms in detail.
                 Certain Events
                 These events are guaranteed to happen; there is no doubt about their occurrence. It will have a probability of 1.
                 For example:

                    • If you flip a fair coin, the probability of it landing heads up or tails up is certain, as one of these outcomes is
                   guaranteed.

                    • The occurrence of sunrise and sunset each day is certain.
                    • When you click a light switch, the light bulb will either turn on or off.
                    • The act of inhaling and exhaling is certain as long as a person is alive.
                    • Time consistently moves forward, and each passing moment is certain.
                    • The beating of the heart is a certain event, as long as a person is alive.
                    • If it is Sunday today, it is certain, tomorrow is going to be a Monday.

                 Likely Events
                 These events have a higher probability of occurring as compared to other events. For example:
                    • If you roll a fair six-sided die, the likelihood of rolling a number greater than 2 (3, 4, 5, or 6) is higher than rolling
                   a number less than or equal to 2 (1, or 2).
                    • If you visit a store known for carrying a wide variety of brands, it’s likely that you’ll find your favourite brand
                   among their products.
                    • If you study well for an exam, you’re more likely to pass with good grades.
                    • If you buy many raffle tickets compared to others, you’re more likely to win a prize.

                 Unlikely Events
                 These events have a lower probability of occurring compared to other events. For example,
                    • If you randomly select a card from a standard deck, the probability of drawing an ace of spades is lower compared
                   to drawing a card of a different suit.
                    • Observing a shooting star in the night sky is an unlikely event compared to seeing regular stars.

                are so many people applying.
                 • If a board result is declared, the chances to be the topper of the school is very unlikely as there is only one topper
                in the school.
              Impossible Events
              These events have no chance of occurring; they are not feasible outcomes. The event will never happen or is
              impossible, it will have a probability of 0. For example,

                 • Rolling a fair six-sided die to get a number greater than 6 or less than 1.
                 • Drawing a card from a standard deck and it turns out to be orange in colour.
                 • The probability that you can pick a red ball from a bag containing only blue balls is 0.
                 • Picking a random day of the week, and it turns out to be both Monday and Friday at the same time.
                 • Picking a guava in an orchard of apples.
                 • The probability of a fish to climb a tree is an impossible event.

              Equal Probability Events
              In this scenario, each event has an equal chance of occurring. For example,
                 • If you roll a fair six-sided die, the probability of rolling any specific number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) is the same because
                each face of the die has an equal chance of landing face up.
                 • To guess a number between 1 and 10, each number has an equal probability of being selected.
                 • The chances of selecting a particular coloured marble from a bag of marbles containing the equal number of
                red, blue, and green marbles are equal.
                 • When students enter in a classroom and select their seats, each desk or chair has an equal chance of being
                chosen.
                 • Selecting a boy or a girl from a class having equal number of girls and number of boys has an equal probability.

              The probability of an event occurring is somewhere between impossible and certain. If an event is certain or sure
              to happen, it will have a probability of 1.

              For example, the probability of taking out a yellow ball from a box containing 10 yellow balls is 1. If an event
              will never happen or is impossible, it will have a probability of 0. For Example, taking out green ball from a box
              containing 10 yellow balls is 0.
              So, the probability of an event occurring lies between 0 and 1.

                 Case 1
                 Health insurance companies often use probability to determine how likely it is that certain individuals will spend a
                 certain amount on healthcare each year and determine risk factors for contracting a disease and for being cured.
                 For example, a company might use factors like age, existing medical conditions, current health status, etc. to
                 determine that there’s a 90% probability that a certain individual will spend `10,000 or more on healthcare in a
                 given year.
                 Individuals who are likely to spend more on healthcare will be charged higher premiums because the insurance
                 company knows that they’ll be more expensive to insure.

                       Applications of Probability


              Probability has a wide range of applications across various fields, making it an essential concept in many areas
              of study and professional practice. Here are some key applications of probability.


              Sports
                 • In cricket, the batting average represents how many runs
                a  batsman  would  score  before  getting  out.  Probability
                can help in estimating the batting average. For instance, if
                a  batsman  had  scored  20  runs  out  of  80  runs  from  only
                boundaries in the last match. Then, there is a chance that he
                will score 25% of his runs in the next match from boundaries.

                   factors. For example, in football (soccer), the probability of a team winning can be calculated based on home
                   advantage, current form, and historical head-to-head results.
                    • Coaches and analysts use probability to predict a player's performance. For example, in basketball, the probability
                   of a player making a free throw can be estimated based on their past success rate.
                    • During games, coaches use probability models to make strategic decisions. For example, in football, when
                   a team scores a touchdown, they have a choice. They can either kick the ball for an easy point or try for a
                   more challenging two-point conversion by running or passing the ball into the end zone again. Coaches use
                   probability to decide which option gives them the best chance of scoring more points.

                    • Teams with players suited to the ground conditions may have a higher probability of winning. For example, if
                   the nature of the pitch favours batsmen or bowlers, can have a substantial impact.


                 Weather Forecasting
                    • Weather forecasters use probability to determine the likelihood of rain, wind,
                   snow, clouds, etc. on a given day in a specific area.
                   For example, forecasters may say things like “there is a 70% chance of rain today
                   between 4 PM and 6 PM” to indicate a medium to high likelihood of rain during
                   certain hours.
                    • Probability helps in understanding long-term climate patterns and changes.
                   For example, estimating the probability of extreme weather events under different
                   climate scenarios aids in planning and mitigation efforts.



                                             Traffic Estimation
                                                • People often use probability when they decide to drive to someplace. Vehicular
                                               traffic flow is examined and an estimated vehicle waiting time in each direction
                                               is estimated through probability.
                                                •  Based on the time of day, location in the city, weather conditions, etc. people tend
                                               to make probability predictions about how bad traffic will be during a certain
                                               time. For example, if you think there’s a 90% chance that traffic will be heavy from
                                               6 PM to 7:30 PM in your vicinity then you may decide to wait during that time.



                 Finance
                    • Probability  is  used  to  assess  the  risk  of  investments  and  financial
                   decisions.
                   For example, calculating the probability of a stock’s return falling within
                   a certain range helps investors make informed decisions.
                    • Probability  models  help  investors  spread  their  investments  across
                   different assets to reduce risk.
                   For example, by looking at the chances of returns for various investments,
                   investors can build a balanced portfolio.
                    • Probability is crucial in figuring out insurance costs and how policies are structured by various insurance agencies.
                   For example, actuaries use probability to predict events like accidents or natural disasters and set insurance
                   premiums based on those chances.

              Education

                 • Probability is used to estimate how well students perform in exams
                based on different factors.

                For example, considering study habits and attendance can predict
                the chances of students getting certain grades.
                 • Probability helps create fair and accurate standardised tests.
                For example, figuring out the chances of different scores in tests, it
                can better reflect how well students understand the subject taught.

                       •  Likely events: The probability of one event is higher than the probability of another event.
                       •  Unlikely events: One event is less likely to happen than another event.
                       •  Impossible events: There’s no chance of an event happening.
                       •  Equal Probability events: Chances of each event happening is the same.
                    2.  List down the areas of applications of statistics.
                   Ans.  The following are the areas of applications of statistics:
                       •  Sports
                       •  Education
                       •  Disaster management
                       •  Weather forecast
                       •  Disease prediction
                       •  Opinion of voters
                    3.   In the upcoming elections, the election commissioner wants to know whether it will be a hung parliament or a party
                       will have a clear majority. Can this be achieved using statistics? How?
                   Ans.  Yes, it can be achieved. By surveying a group of voters and analysing the results, statistics can reveal what the majority
                       of people think about political candidates, policies, or upcoming elections. This helps politicians and decision-makers
                       understand public opinion.
                    4.  How is probability helpful for a student in studying a specific topic?
                   Ans.  •   Students can use probability to estimate the likelihood of achieving certain grades based on their past performance
                         and study habits.
                       •  By analysing the probability of different outcomes, students can prioritise their study time more effectively.
                       •   If a topic has a high probability of appearing on an exam, students can prioritise their study efforts accordingly.
                    5.  How can probability help in the field of medicine?
                   Ans.  •   Probability helps in understanding how diseases spread and how well treatments work. For example, by estimating
                         the chance of disease transmission in different situations, we can better plan public health measures.
                       •   Probability is used to determine the effectiveness of new treatments or drugs. For example, researchers calculate the
                         probability that observed treatment effects are due to the drug rather than random chance.

                    1.  Nikhil wants to understand customer satisfaction and collects data through feedback forms where customers rate their
                       satisfaction on a scale from 1 to 10. What steps should Nikhil take to explore and clean the customer satisfaction data?
                   Ans.  Nikhil should look first at the data to find patterns, like the range of study hours and grades. He also cleans the data by
                       fixing any missing or incorrect information (e.g., if some students didn’t fill in all the fields or gave unrealistic answers).

                 The simpler it is to understand the context through visualisation (images), the more difficult it is to identify,
                 whether the image is real or artificial. Today, 50% of the images we see online are a result of Generative Artificial
                 Intelligence (Gen AI).

                 Let us learn more about it.


                         Real Images vs AI-Generated Images


                 Real images are captured by cameras, they are visual representations depicting scenes, objects, or people in the
                 same way as they exist in the real world. They are created on the same side of the lens or mirror as the viewer.
                 These images are either created by or clicked by humans.

                 AI-generated images are created using AI algorithms. These algorithms use large amount of data and learn
                 patterns to create new images that look like real ones. Sometimes AI incorporates small details that don't exist in
                 the original picture to enhance the look of the scene. AI can create images that can be modified and enhanced.
                 It can also create entirely new, imaginative images.

                      Companies like OpenAI, Google, Facebook, and NVIDIA have invested heavily in research and
                      development of generative AI technologies.




                         AI or Real Image….How to Identify?


                 Distinguishing  between  a  real image  and  one  generated by  AI can  be  challenging as  AI-generated  images
                 continue to become more sophisticated. However, there are a few indicators you can look for:
                    • Artificial intelligence shows inconsistencies if observed closely, although it tries to piece together its creations
                   from the  original work. The artefacts can  include unnatural  blurriness, inconsistent lighting/shadowing,  or
                   repeating patterns, specially in the backgrounds.
                    • AI-generated images may include elements that seem unrealistic or improbable, such as impossible perspectives,
                   mismatched colours, or objects that defy physics, making the image appear unnatural or inconsistent with the
                   scene.

                    • Odd outlines to sharpen or smoothen the edges, stray pixels to cover inconsistency, and abnormal shapes can
                   be easily seen, if an image is zoomed to the maximum, on each of its parts.
                 Let's look at the concepts behind the generation of these images.


                                                                                  Introduction to Generative AI  323]]></page><page Index="326"><![CDATA[Supervised Learning and Discriminative Modelling

              Supervised Learning is a type of Machine Learning where we teach models using examples that have labels. It
              uses labelled datasets to train algorithms to predict outcomes and recognise patterns.

              These labels tell the model the correct answer for each example. Discriminative Modelling is a special kind of
              supervised learning that focuses on learning how to distinguish different classes. It looks at the features of the
              data to figure out which class it belongs to.


              Supervised Learning

              Supervised learning is a machine learning where a model is trained on a labelled dataset, implying that each
              input data point is associated with a corresponding output label. The goal of supervised learning is to learn the
              mapping between input data and output labels, enabling the model to make predictions on new, unseen data.
              Supervised learning is when we train the machine using labelled data. The machine is provided with a new set
              of labelled data so that the supervised learning algorithm analyses the training data and generates the most
              suitable and related outcome from the trained-labelled data. Labeled data contains data with the correct output
              or classification. In simple words, input data is paired with the desired output thus making the machine learn to
              predict the output for new input data.

              For example, in the given images, first is the input image and characteristics of this image are marked as boy
              and ball, which can be seen in center image. Now, according to supervised learning it has to learn the mapping
              between input labels and output labels, which is shown in last image and highlights "ball" as red, "boy" as purple
              and "boy playing with a ball" in a rectangle.


                                                                                                  Output
                             Input                    Features of given image
                                                                                             Label for the item
















                                                          Boy      Ball                    Boy playing with a ball

              In a supervised learning model, a labelled dataset is given to the machine. A labelled dataset is the information
              which is tagged with identifiers of data. For example, clothes in a store are marked under various categories of
              clothing like Shirts, Trousers, Coats, etc. They are further labelled as per gender and size.


              Discriminative Modelling
              Discriminative modelling is an approach in machine learning where the focus is on learning the boundary or
              decision boundary that separates different classes or categories directly from the data. So, if an image contains
              a combination of Dogs and Cats, the model is able to tell which is a Dog and which is a Cat.

                                             Cats = 2                            Dog = 1

                 In supervised learning, discriminative modelling contrasts with generative modelling, where the goal is to model
                 the joint probability distribution of both the input features and the output labels. Generative models can be
                 used to generate new data points that resemble the training data, whereas discriminative models are primarily
                 focused on classification or regression tasks.

                 Let us consider an example.
                 A father has two kids, Kid A and Kid B. Kid A has a special learning ability where he can learn everything in depth.
                 Kid B has a special learning ability where he can only learn the differences between what he saw.

                 One fine day, the father shows his kids (Kid A and Kid B) two kinds of animals, a dog and a cat. After a few days,
                 the father showed them an animal and asked both of them “Is this animal a dog or a cat?”
                 Kid A drew the image of a dog and a cat on a piece of paper based on what he saw earlier. He compared both the
                 images with the animal standing before him and answered based on the closest match of the image and animal,
                 he answered: “The animal is a dog.” Kid B knows only the differences, based on different properties learned, he
                 answered: “The animal is a dog.”

                 Here, we can see both of them are finding the kind of animal, but the way of learning and the way of finding
                 the answer is entirely different. In machine learning, we generally call Kid A as a generative model & Kid B as a
                 discriminative model.

                       Unsupervised Learning and Generative Modelling


              Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where models are trained using data that does not have
              labels. This means the model has to find patterns and relationships in the data on its own. Generative modelling
              is a specific approach within unsupervised learning that focuses on understanding and modelling how the data
              is generated. Generative models try to learn the underlying rules that produce the data, so they can create new
              examples that look similar to the original data. In summary, Unsupervised learning is about finding patterns in
              unlabelled data, and generative modelling is a method within this type of learning that aims to understand and
              replicate how the data is made.


              Unsupervised Learning


                                                                     Output

              The goal of unsupervised learning is to find patterns, structures, or representations in the data without human
              intervention. An unsupervised learning approach works on an unlabelled dataset. This means that the data
              which is fed to the machine is random and there is no know-how available about it to the trainer.

                 Generative Modelling do not necessarily require labelled datasets. It can work with unlabelled data to learn the
                 underlying distribution of the data and can generate structured data from the random noise dataset. So, if
                 random images are fed as training data for the model it can create relevant output based on the features of the
                 input data. If there are random images which depict streets, cars, buildings, sky, etc. In a given dataset of street

              A "random noise dataset" typically refers to a collection of data points or samples where each data point is
              generated randomly. There are unpredictable fluctuations and disorganised data, which makes it impossible to
              identify target patterns or relationships in it. This may result in decreased accuracy or reliability of the output,
              which are corrected by generative AI.

                         What is Generative AI?


                 Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), also known as Gen AI, encompasses algorithms designed to produce new
                 data closely resembling human-generated content across various forms, including audio, code, images, text,
                 simulations, and videos. Leveraging existing data and content for training, Generative AI holds promise for
                 applications spanning natural language processing, computer vision, the metaverse, and speech synthesis. As it
                 undergoes continuous training with more data, this technology evolves, progressively refining its capabilities. Its
                 growing popularity stems from the intuitive interaction it enables, allowing users to prompt the AI using natural
                 language. Notably, the output generated by generative AI often achieves a level of quality indistinguishable
                 from human creation. Within Generative AI, a "prompt" serves as the initial input or instruction guiding the
                 AI model in generating desired content. For instance, in a text generation model, a prompt may consist of a
                 sentence or keywords, while in an image generation model, it could entail a description of the desired image.

              together in a unique adversarial process to create realistic synthetic data. These two neural networks are as
              follows:
                 • Generator Network: It produces data that is as close as possible to real data.
                 • Discriminator Network: It analyses data and provides feedback, i.e. it takes real data and the data generated
                by the generator as input and attempts to distinguish between the two.

              These two networks work together in a cycle where the generator tries to create realistic fake data, and the
              discriminator tries to identify whether the data is real or fake. This back-and-forth process helps the generator
              improve and produce more convincing data over time.

              Some of the examples of GANs are as follows:
                 • It can create portraits of non-existing people.

                 • It can convert images from day to night.
                 • It can generate images based on textual description, for example, if we give a description of a bird, then it will
                create an image that is similar to the description.
                 • It can generate realistic video, which can be used in film production, video games, and generating synthetic data
                for training other AI models, etc.

                 A variational autoencoder (VAE) is a Generative AI algorithm that uses deep learning to generate new content,
                 detect anomalies, and remove noise. This is another class of generative models. To produce fresh data, VAEs
                 learn the distribution of the data and then sample from it.

                 Some of the examples of VAEs are as follows:
                    • It can generate new images like the given training set. For instance, a VAE trained on images of faces can
                   generate new, realistic-looking faces.
                    • It can produce new text that follows the same style and structure as the training data, assisting writers with
                   drafts and ideas.
                    • It can be used for composing new music pieces or creating sound effects, music composition, etc.


                 Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

                 RNNs are a special class of neural networks that excel at handling sequential data, like music or text. They excel
                 at tasks where the order of the data points is important, as they can remember previous inputs and use this
                 information to influence current outputs.

                 • It can generate novel text in the style of a specific author or genre, like creating new sentences that mimic the
                style of Shakespeare or generating dialogue for a chatbot.
                 • It can predict the next character or word in a sequence, like autocomplete features in text editors and predictive
                text input on smartphones.
                 • It can be used to predict future values in a time series, such as stock prices or weather data, by learning patterns
                from historical data.


              Autoencoders (AEs)
              These are neural networks that have been trained to learn a compressed representation of data. They work by
              compressing the data into a lower-dimensional form (encoding) and then decompressing it back to its original
              form (decoding). This process helps the network learn the most important features of the data.






                                                                    Latent Space

              Some of the examples of AEs are as follows:

                 • It can help in cleaning up noisy images to produce clear and highly realistic samples.
                 • It can help in compressing high-resolution images for efficient storage and transmission.
                 • It can create artistic images based on learned features from famous paintings.
                 • It can help in drug discovery by learning and generating molecular structures that have desirable properties.


              Similarities and Differences between AEs and VAEs

              The similarities and differences between Autoencoders (AEs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are as follows:

              Similarities
                 • Both AE and VAE are neural network architectures that are used for Unsupervised Learning
                 • Both AE and VAE consist of an encoder and a decoder network. The encoder maps the input data to a latent
                representation, and decoder maps the latent representation back to the original data.
                 • Both AE and VAE can be used for tasks such as dimensionality reduction, data generation, and anomaly detection.

                                                         people without sacrificing quality.



                 Limitations of Using Generative AI
                 Some disadvantages of Generative AI are as follows:
                    • Data bias: When Generative AI learns from biased or incomplete data, it tends to reflect those biases in its
                   output. This means the results may be skewed or flawed, especially in critical areas like facial recognition or
                   natural language processing, where accuracy is paramount.


                    • Uncertainty: Generative AI has a knack for surprising us with unexpected results. While this can sometimes
                   lead to exciting discoveries, it can also be a bit of a mixed bag, as the outcomes can be unpredictable.

                    • Computational demands: Generative AI isn't shy about its appetite for computational power. It demands
                   hefty resources for training and generating output, which can be both expensive and time-consuming. So,
                   while it's undeniably powerful, it can also drain the resources.

                         Ethical Considerations of using Generative AI


                 While Generative AI offers many benefits, there are also several ethical considerations that should be considered
                 when using this technology.

                    • Ownership: There's a  gray  area  concerning  who  owns content  created  by  Generative AI. This is especially
                   significant in creative fields like music, literature, and art, where AI can produce original works that blur the lines
                   between human and machine authorship.
                    • Human Agency: Generative AI prompts questions about human control and autonomy. As technology advances,
                   it may become harder to distinguish  between content made by humans and that made by machines. This
                   blurring of lines could result in a loss of human agency and control.
                    • Bias: Generative AI learns from the data it's fed, meaning biased data can result in biased AI-generated content.
                   This bias can have harmful effects, particularly in high-stakes areas like hiring, loan approvals, or criminal justice.

                    • Misinformation: Generative AI can be used to create fake news or deep fakes, which can spread misinformation
                   and sway public opinion. This poses a threat to democracy and undermines trust in authorities.
                    • Privacy: There's a risk that Generative AI could be used to generate sensitive personal information, such as credit
                   card numbers or medical records, which could then be exploited for malicious purposes. Protecting privacy is
                   crucial in preventing such misuse.


                         The Potential Negative Impact on Society


                 1.  Spread of Misinformation and Fake News

                    a.  Fake News: AI can generate convincing fake news articles and social media posts, spreading misinformation
                       quickly and widely.
                    b.  Deepfakes: The term "deepfake" combines "deep learning" and "fake," referring to AI techniques that
                       create realistic but fake videos and audios. These AI-generated videos can mislead people by making
                       it seem like someone said or did something which they didn't, undermining trust in public figures and
                       institutions.

                 2.  Lead to Job Displacement

                    a.  Automation: Generative AI can perform tasks traditionally done by humans, such as writing, graphic
                       design, and customer service, potentially leading to significant job displacement.



                                                                                  Introduction to Generative AI  345]]></page><page Index="348"><![CDATA[b.  Economic Disruption: Workers who lose their jobs may struggle financially, face higher unemployment,
                     and find it harder to get new jobs without the required skills.
              3.  Privacy and Data Security Risks
                  a.  Sensitive Information: AI can inadvertently or maliciously generate sensitive personal information, like
                     social security numbers or medical records, which can be exploited for identity theft or fraud.

                  b.  Data Breaches:  The  misuse  of  AI  to  access  or  generate  personal  data  poses  significant  risks  to  an
                     individual's privacy and security.

              4.  Ethical and Moral Concerns
                  a.  Bias and Discrimination: AI models trained on biased data can produce biased outputs, reinforcing
                     stereotypes and discrimination.

                  b.  Dehumanisation: Relying too much on AI for tasks that need human understanding and compassion
                     can make services and interactions feel less personal and caring.

              5.  Security Threats
                  a.  Cyber Attacks: AI can be used to develop sophisticated cyber-attacks, including generating malicious
                     code or automated phishing schemes.
                  b.  Weaponisation:  Generative AI could be used to create harmful technologies or weapons, posing
                     significant national security risks.

              6.  Environmental Impact

                  a.   Training and running large AI models require significant computational resources, contributing to high
                     energy consumption and environmental impact.

                  b.  Many devices are being exchanged due to outdated hardware leading to increase in e-waste.

                                                  SECTION B (Subjective Type Questions)

                 A.  Short answer type questions:

                    1.  How can you tell if an image is real or AI?
                   Ans.  Artificial intelligence shows inconsistencies if observed closely, although it tries to piece together its creations from
                       the original work. Odd outlines to sharpen or smoothen the edges, stray pixels to cover inconsistency, and abnormal
                       shapes can be easily seen, if an image is zoomed to the maximum, on each of its parts.

                    2.  What are the environmental impacts of generative AI?
                   Ans.  ●  Training  and  running  large  AI  models  require  significant  computational  resources,  contributing  to  high  energy
                        consumption and environmental impact.
                       ● Many devices are being exchanged due to outdated hardware leading to increase in e-waste.

                                                                                  Introduction to Generative AI  349]]></page><page Index="352"><![CDATA[3.  List the important features of real images captured by camera.
                Ans.  Real images captured by cameras are visual representations depicting scenes, objects, or people in exactly the same
                    way as they exist in the real world. These images are created by humans or nature and are unaltered.
                  4.  What is a supervised learning model?
                Ans.  In a supervised learning model, a labelled dataset is given to the machine. A labelled dataset is the information, which
                    is tagged with identifiers of data. For example, clothes in a store are marked under various categories of clothing like
                    Shirts, Trousers, Coats, etc. They are further labelled as per gender and size.
                  5.  Explain the term deepfake.

                Ans.  The term "deepfake" combines "deep learning" and "fake," referring to AI techniques that create realistic but fake videos
                    and audio. These AI-generated videos can mislead people by making it seem like someone said or did something they
                    didn't, undermining trust in public figures and institutions.

                  6.  What is the use of Generative Modelling?
                Ans.  Generative modelling is a specific approach within unsupervised learning that focuses on understanding and modelling
                    how the data is generated.

                  7.  What is a random noise dataset?
                Ans.  A "random noise dataset" typically refers to a collection of data points or samples where each data point is generated
                    randomly. There are unpredictable fluctuations and disorganised data, which makes it impossible to identify target
                    patterns or relationships in it. This may result in decreased accuracy or reliability of the output, which the generative AI
                    model takes care of.

                  8.  What is Generative AI?
                Ans.  Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), also called Gen AI, refers to the algorithms that generate new data that resembles
                    human-generated content, such as audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos.
                  9.  Differentiate between Generative AI and Conventional AI in terms of goals.

                Ans.  Generative AI creates new content that mimics the original content. This content includes images, text, music, or other
                    forms of media. Whereas conventional AI analyses, processes, and classifies data. It basically works to improve the
                    accuracy, precision, recall, and speed within the scope of the defined task.

                 10.  Explain VAEs with example.
                Ans.  This is another class of generative models. In order to produce fresh data, VAEs learn the distribution of the data and
                    then sample from it.

                    Example: Generation of new images similar to the given training set. For instance, a VAE trained on images of faces can
                    generate new, realistic-looking faces.


              B.  Long answer type questions:
                  1.  How does Discriminative Modelling contrast with Generative Modelling?
                Ans.  In supervised learning, discriminative modelling contrasts with generative modelling, where the goal is to model the
                    joint probability distribution of both the input features and the output labels. Generative models  can be used to
                    generate new data points that resemble the training data, whereas discriminative models are primarily focused on
                    classification or regression tasks.

                  2.  What are the limitations of Gen AI?
                Ans.  Limitations of Using Generative AI
                    ●   Data bias: If generative AI is trained on biased or incomplete data, the output may be similarly biased or flawed.
                       This can lead to inaccurate or problematic results in certain applications, such as in facial recognition or natural
                       language processing.

                         and a drawback.
                       ●   Computational demands: Generative AI requires significant computational resources to train and generate its
                         output, which can be expensive and time-consuming.
                    3.  Explain the concept of Recurrent Neural Networks with example.
                   Ans.  RNNs are a special class of neural networks that excel at handling sequential data, like music or text. They excel at tasks
                       where the order of the data points is important, as they can remember previous inputs and use this information to
                       influence current outputs.
                       For example, it can generate novel text in the style of a specific author or genre, like creating new sentences that mimic
                       the style of Shakespeare or generating dialogue for a chatbot.

                    4.  Explain how generative AI is being used in Art with example.
                   Ans.   Generative AI can create new artworks by learning styles from famous painters and generating novel pieces in similar
                       styles.
                       For example:
                       ●  AI artists like "AI Portraits" and "DeepArt" have gained popularity for their ability to create visually stunning images.
                       ●  The Next Rembrandt project used data analysis and 3D printing to create a new painting in the style of Rembrandt.

                    5.  Give three benefits of using generative AI.
                   Ans.  ●   Creativity: Generative AI can assist creatives in pushing the boundaries in making creative processes more efficient
                         and personalised. This can be particularly valuable in fields such as art, design, and music.
                       ●   Efficiency: Generative AI can automate content creation processes, which can save time and reduce costs compared
                         to traditional manual processes.
                       ●   Personalisation: Generative AI can be used to create personalised content for individual users based on their
                         preferences and behaviours, such as customised product recommendations or personalised news articles.


                 C.   Competency-based/Application-based questions:                    #Environmental Awareness

                    1.  Hema is a content creator using a generative AI tool to produce images for a marketing campaign. How would she
                       ensure the images generated by the AI look original and are not infringe on any existing copyrights? What steps would
                       she take to verify the originality of the AI-generated content?
                   Ans.  Hema can ensure the images generated by AI look original by utilising AI tools designed to create unique content and
                       by cross-referencing the outputs with existing image databases to check for similarities. She should employ copyright
                       verification services to detect any potential infringements. Additionally, using licensed AI tools that guarantee original
                       outputs can help. Finally, Hema should keep detailed records of the AI's generation process for accountability.

                    2.  “OrStim” organisation is using generative AI to create synthetic voices for virtual assistants. How would the company
                       ensure the synthetic voices are natural and engaging while avoiding any potential misuse, such as generating misleading
                       or harmful audio content? What guidelines should the company establish for ethical use?
                   Ans.  “OrStim” can ensure the synthetic voices are natural and engaging by training the AI on diverse and high-quality voice
                       datasets, focusing on clarity and emotional expression. To avoid misuse, they should implement filters to detect and
                       block harmful or misleading content generation.

              A computer is just a machine that gives the result based on the instructions or inputs given to it. In order
              to get a problem solved by a computer, we need to give step-by-step instructions to the computer.  These
              step-by-step instructions written in any programming language to do a specific task is known as a program. A
              program is written in any programming language which the computer can understand and execute. Algorithms
              and flowchart are powerful tools for learning programming.

              In this chapter, we are going to learn about basic concepts of programming including problem-solving, control
              structure, algorithm, and flowchart.


                       Steps Involved in Computer Problem Solving


              Before we write a program, we need to learn the basic objective of it. Why do we need a program and what
              purpose does it solve? To solve this problem of writing a program, we follow some steps as given below:

              1.  Understanding the problem: This is a crucial step where we need to understand the main objective of the
                 problem. In this step, we should clearly define the problem, gather all necessary requirements, understand
                 constraints, and clarify goals. These actions are essential to moving in the right direction and finding an
                 effective solution.
              2.  Analysing the problem: Break down the problem into smaller parts, identify inputs and outputs, and explore
                 existing solutions. Consider edge cases and unusual scenarios. This comprehensive analysis sets a detailed
                 plan for tackling the problem.

                   always recommended to first write an algorithm and draw a flowchart for solving a problem and then only
                   write the program. This translates analysis into a practical, actionable plan.
                 4.  Coding and implementation: This is the last step where every instruction of an algorithm is converted into
                   a computer understandable instruction by using the syntax and semantic of a specific computer language.


                         Control Structures

                 Control structures are a set of instructions that control the flow of instructions in a program. It is a programming
                 tool that determines the order of execution of the statements in any programming language. There are three
                 different types of control structures: sequential flow, selection flow, and repetition flow.
                 Let us learn about these in detail.

                 Sequential Flow

                 In sequential flow, the statements are placed one after the other and the flow of execution occurs starting from line
                 1, line 2 and so on with a top-down approach. It is the default flow followed in any programming language. For
                 example, the steps for calculating the percentage of any student by taking as an input marks of English, Science,
                 Maths are as follows:
                 Step 1   Start

                 Step 2   Input Eng, Science, Math
                 Step 3   Total = Eng+Science+Math
                 Step 4   Percentage = (Total / Maximum_Marks) * 100
                 Step 5   Display Percentage
                 Step 6   Stop


                 Selection Flow
                 Selection flow is also known as branching control as the flow of control branches based on a condition. A
                 condition evaluates to either TRUE or FALSE. In the case of TRUE, the flow of control follows the set of instructions
                 written for True. In case it is FALSE, then it follows the other route. For example, consider the scenario where an
                 award is given only if the percentage is more than 90:
                 Step 1   Start
                 Step 2   Input Eng,Science, Math
                 Step 3   Total= Eng+Science+Math
                 Step 4   Percentage = (Total / Maximum_Marks) * 100

                 Step 5   Display Percentage
                 Step 6   If Percentage> 90 then
                              Display "Award given"
                 Step 7   else

                              Display "No award"
                 Step 8   Stop

                 Repetition Flow

                 Repetition flow, also known as a loop, repeats a set of instructions a number of times based on a condition. For
                 example, if we wish to repeat the above steps of calculating percentage for 10 students then we use the concept
                 of repetition.
                                                                                        Introduction to Python  359]]></page><page Index="362"><![CDATA[Step 1   Start
               Step 2   count=1

               Step 3   if count <=10 goto Step 4 else goto step 10
               Step 4   Input Eng,Science, Math
               Step 5   Total= Eng+Science+Math
               Step 6   Percentage = (Total / Maximum_Marks) * 100

               Step 9   Goto Step 3
               Step 10  Stop


                       Algorithm


              An algorithm is a step-by-step approach to identify and solve a problem in a finite amount of time. It is used in the
              problem-solving phase of any programming task and helps in defining clear instructions in sequence. An algorithm
              uses simple English-like statements to represent the steps of a program. There may be more than one way to solve
              any problem, so there may be more than one algorithm for a given problem. It must terminate after a finite number
              of steps. Once we have an algorithm, we can translate it into a computer program in any programming language.




                            Brainy Fact


                   The word 'algorithm' come from the name of a Persian mathematician called Al-Khwārizmī.




              Writing an Algorithm

              Let us do an activity of writing an algorithm for making cucumber and tomato sandwich:

               Step 1   Take a few slices of tomato and a cucumber.
               Step 2   Take two slices of multigrain bread.

               Step 3   Put tomato sauce on one slice of bread.

               Step 4   Put cheese spread on the other slice of bread.

               Step 5   Place a few slices of tomato and cucumber between the two slices of bread.

               Step 6   Cut the sandwich into two halves and serve it.

              Advantages of an Algorithm

              The advantages of an algorithm are as follows:
                 • It is a step-by-step representation of a solution to a given problem.
                 • It uses simple English-like statements, so it is easy to understand and write.
                 • The  problem is broken down  into smaller pieces, hence,  it is easy to convert it into a  program  using any
                 programming language.

                 The disadvantages of an algorithm are as follows:
                    • There is no standard rule for writing an algorithm, it varies drastically.
                    • The process of creating an algorithm can be time-consuming.
                    • It is difficult to represent branching and looping in an algorithm.

              A flowchart is a graphical representation of an algorithm. It makes use of symbols which are connected through
              arrows to show the direction of flow of information. It has been proved scientifically that visuals have more
              impact on the human brain as compared with text. So, flowcharts are preferred over algorithms for solving a
              problem. The symbols are:

                       What is CodeCombat?

              CodeCombat is a free coding educational game that teaches you to learn JavaScript or Python coding in a fun
              way. It is available for all age groups to suit the needs of all levels of coding and computer science learners.
              There are self-paced games with practice levels and hints in case you get stuck. If you master the skill of coding
              then there are few challenge levels also. It is equivalent to doing beginners level courses in any programming
              language. There are two coding programs:

                 • CodeCombat: It is the company's original coding game recommended for parents, individuals, educators and
                 students.

                 • Ozaria: It is an adventure game, fantasy story, and Computer Science program recommended for educators
                 and students.

                       Programming Language

              A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce
              various kinds of output. It has its own vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer to
              perform specific tasks.

              For example, BASIC, Pascal, C, C++, Java, Haskell, Ruby, Python, etc. are some popular programming languages.

              What is a computer program?

              A computer program is a set of instructions written in any programming language that perform a specific task
              when executed by a computer. These instructions are executed by the computer's processor to achieve the
              desired output.
              In this unit we will learn about Python as a programming language to write computer programs.

                       What is Python?


              Python is a general-purpose, object-oriented, easy-to-learn and high-level programming language. Guido van
              Rossum designed Python and released it in 1991. He wanted to give a unique name to it so he named it after
              the famous BBC comedy TV show "Monty Python's Flying Circus".
              Python as a language supports simple English-like statements, making it easy for programmers to learn and
              maintain. This is one important reason for its popularity.

                       Important Features of Python

              Python is a very popular programming language. Let us study some of its important features to find out the
              reasons for its popularity:
                 • High-Level Language: Python is a high-level and general-purpose programming language which simplifies the
                 process of developing a program. The code written in Python is more close to human language and away from
                 machine language.


                    372     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-IX]]></page><page Index="375"><![CDATA[• Easy to Learn and Use: Python has simple, English-like statements that are easy to learn and use. Anyone can
                   easily get used to its syntax and have expertise in it.
                    • Expressive Language: Python supports simple code that expresses itself in a few lines to do big and complicated
                   tasks.
                    • Free and Open Source: Python code is developed under an OSI-approved open-source licence, which allows it
                   to be downloaded free of cost from its official website, https://www.python.org. The code can be modified and
                   distributed further, even for commercial purposes.
                    • Cross-platform Language: Python supports multiple platforms, like Windows, Linux, Mac, Raspberry Pi, etc.,
                   which means code written on one platform can easily run on another platform with little or no changes.
                    • Interpreted Language: Python uses an interpreter where the source code is converted and executed line by
                   line at a time.
                    • Object-Oriented Language: Python supports the concept of classes and objects that make its code efficient
                   and reusable with important features like polymorphism, inheritance, data encapsulation, etc.
                    • Supports GUI: Python supports a Graphical User Interface which makes its more user friendly and easy for the
                   programmers to design code.
                    • Large Standard Library:  Python  has  some  built-in  modules  and  packages  for  doing  some  standard  and
                   common tasks. These important libraries make it popular, especially in AI-based programs where we need to
                   focus more on its use than its core design.
                    • Portability and compatibility: It refers to the ability of Python programs to run on various types of computer
                   systems and operating systems without modification in the code.
                    • Database and Scalable: Python provides strong support for database interactions, allowing developers to
                   efficiently connect, manipulate, and query databases with good support for the growth of applications in terms
                   of performance, complexity, and data size.

                         Role of Python in Artificial Intelligence


                 Python is the most popular language for Artificial Intelligence based on the facts given below:
                    • Built-in Libraries: Many built-in modules and packages in Python reduce the development time and effort
                   required to design code for artificial intelligence. There are Numpy for scientific computation, PyBrain for Python
                   Machine Language, Scipy for advanced computing, Pandas for general-purpose data analysis, and many more.
                    • Platform Independence: Python has this versatile nature of running the code in any platform like Windows, MacOS,
                   Linux, Unix, etc. Packages like PyInstaller can be used to prepare the code that can run on different platforms.

                    • Extensible: We can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter that help a programmer customise their
                   tools in an efficient manner.
                    • Availability of Data Analysis Tools: Libraries like Matplotlib help data scientists build charts and histograms and
                   plot them for easy comparison of data, which is important for creating data analysis reports with visual effects.
                    • Community Support: Python, being one of the most popular languages, has attracted a lot of developers to
                   design online forums and online tutorials to provide assistance related to different types of programming in
                   Python. This community support has been an important factor in using Python in AI design.

                         Applications of Python

                 Following are some applications of Python:

                    • Used for Web and Internet Application Development: Python has pre-built libraries and web frameworks
                   like Pyramid, Django, and Flask, which are used for backend web development projects. Some standard libraries
                   also support content design, database connectivity, and many Internet protocols like HTTP, SMTP, XML, etc.

                                                                                        Introduction to Python  373]]></page><page Index="376"><![CDATA[• Scientific and Numeric Calculation: SciPy, Pandas, IPython are some of the built-in packages in Python that

                               Brainy Fact

                      Many big companies, like Facebook, Google, NASA, MIT, Nokia, IBM, and many more, use Python
                      for their products and services.




                         Working in Python


                 IDLE is the standard, most popular Python development environment. It allows you to write, edit, run, browse
                 and debug the Python programs from a single interface.
                 We can interact with Python IDLE in two different modes:
                    • Interactive Mode (Python IDLE-Shell Mode): In this mode, you type one command at a time in front of the
                   Python command prompt (>>>) and Python gives you the result based on the command given. It means you
                   run code directly on shell mode accessed through the terminal of an operating system. This mode will not save
                   your commands and outputs and should be used only when you want to play with small one-line instructions.
                   You can also use the print( ) function to print the messages on the Shell window.















                                                               Interactive mode
                    • Script Mode (Editor): In this mode, you save all your commands together in any text editor with the extension
                   .py. When we run this text file .py then the output of the commands will be displayed in Shell mode.

                   The steps to write and save a program are as follows:
                   Step 1   Open the Python IDLE window.
                   Step 2   Click on the File menu. A drop-down menu appears.
                   Step 3   Click on the New File option.





                                                                                        Introduction to Python  375]]></page><page Index="378"><![CDATA[The New File Option

                 Step 5   Click on the File → Save option from the menu bar. The Save As dialog box appears.
                 Step 6   Navigate the location where you want to save the file and enter the name of the file in the File name
                          text box.

                 Step 7   Click on the Save button.

              The file will be saved by the given name at the specified location.

              Follow these steps to run a Python program:
                 Step 1   Click on Run in the Menu bar.
                 Step 2   Click on the Run Module option. OR Press F5 Function key.

                     in Google Docs, Google Sheets or Google Slides.



                         Python Character Set


                 A character set can be a set of valid characters. For example,
                    • Digits like 0, 1, 2, …. 9
                    • Letters in upper or lowercase like A to Z or a to z
                    • Special symbols like $, %, ^, &, *, (), @, !, etc.

                    • Whitespaces like spacebar, Tab key or Enter key
                    • ASCII or UNICODE characters like emoji symbols or other symbols with unique code.


                         Statements in Python

                 Instructions written in source code that are executed by a Python interpreter are called statements. There are
                 three types of statements in Python which are simple statements, multiline statements and multiple statements.
                 Let us learn about them in detail.


                 Simple Statements
                 By default, the end of a statement is done by pressing an Enter key. Each statement is written on a new line.

                                                                                        Introduction to Python  377]]></page><page Index="380"><![CDATA[a=5 # is a simple statement where variable 'a' is created with value 5.

              Multiline Statements
              We  can  make  a  statement  that  extends  over  multiple  lines.  There  are  number  of  ways  of  making  multiline
              statement. Few are given below:
              1.  a = 4 + 5 +\

              Multiple statements represent more than one statement in a single line. This can be done by separating the
              statements using semicolon (;).

                 a = 5; b = 10; c = a + b; print(c)


                       Tokens

              Tokens are the smallest meaningful unit of a program. Python supports the following tokens:
                 • Keywords
                 • Identifiers
                 • Literals

                 • Punctuators
                 • Operators
              Let us discuss each of these in detail.


              Keywords
              Keywords in Python are predefined and reserved words with special meanings and purposes and are not allowed
              to be used as identifiers. We can see the list of the reserved keywords by giving the following command at the
              Python command prompt:

                   >>>import keyword
                   >>>keyword.kwlist
              Following is the list of keywords displayed by running the above commands:

              ['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class',
              'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global',
              'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise',
              'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']

                 Identifiers are the user-defined names of variables, list, dictionary, tuples, classes, etc. They identify an element
                 in Python.

                 Naming the identifiers follows the given rules:
                    • It can contain alphabets (uppercase, lowercase), numbers or underscore(_).
                    • Must begin with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).

                    • No special characters like $, period(.), space, etc. are allowed.
                    • It should not be a Python keyword.
                    • It is case-sensitive (uppercase and lowercase letters are different).
                 Example of invalid identifiers are:

                 First name   :   Spaces not allowed
                 Last&Name  :    Cannot have special character
                 9thclass     :   Cannot begin with number
                 else         :   Keyword not allowed
                 Examples of valid identifiers are:
                 Myclass, class9, Address, address, first_name, city, student_id, data123

                 Literals

                 It is defined as any data stored in a variable. It is a constant whose value never change during the program
                 execution. Different types of literals in Python are as follows:
                    • String literals: They are sequence of words enclosed in single, double, or triple quotes. For example,
                            "Hello"
                            'Python'

                    • Numeric literals: They can be integer, float or complex. For example,
                            14
                            20.5
                            2+5j

                    • Boolean literals: They can be True or False. For example,
                            True

                    • None literals: Only None is a special literal. It means something not yet created.

                 Punctuators

                 Punctuators are special symbols used in Python to organise statements and expressions. Most commonly used
                 punctuators in Python are:

                 ' " # \ () {} [] @ , : . =

                 Operators

                 Operators are special symbols used to perform mathematical, logical and relational operations on variables
                 and values. The variables or values on which the operators work are called operands. Some commonly used
                 operators in Python are arithmetic operators, relational operators, logical operators and augmented assignment
                 operators.

                   •  If we use + (Addition) operator with strings, it concatenates two values.
                   •   If we use * (Multiplication) operator with String and integer value, it repeats string value same
                      number of times.



              Relational Operators
              Relational operators or comparison operators compare the values given on both the side of the operators and
              returns the boolean value either True or False.

                           Brainy Fact

                   In case of OR operator, the second condition is checked only if the first is False otherwise it ignores
                   the second operand.




              Assignment Operator
              Assignment operator is used to assign a value to a variable or a constant. = sign is used as an assignment
              operator in Python. For example,
                 rollno = 12
                myname = "Alisha"
                mymarks = 92.5
              Augmented Assignment Operators
              Augmented assignment operators are those operators which take the value of the operand on the right side,
              perform an operation and assign the result to the operand on the left side. These operators are also known as
              shorthand assignment operators. For example, if a=10 then a+=5 is the same as a=a+5.
              Python provides the following augmented assignment operators:

                         Operator Precedence

                 An expression is made up of values, variables, operators and functions. For example,
                            x-5+6 is an expression

                 To evaluate an expression with multiple operators, Python follows an order of precedence. This order can be
                 altered by writing an expression within parentheses.

                 The order of precedence in descending order is listed below:
                                        Order of Precedence                    Operators

                   •  5 * (10 + 5) + 10 – 5




                       Variables


              A variable is a name given to a memory location to hold a specific value. It is just like a container that can hold
              any type of data that can be changed later in the program.

              Variable has:
                 • A name that follows the identifier naming conventions and is case-sensitive.
                 • A value that can be integer, float, string, boolean, etc.

              Unlike  other  programming  languages,  variables  in  Python  are  not  created  before  use.  They  are  created
              automatically when a value is assigned to them by using the assignment operator (=).
              A variable assigned a value of one type can be re-assigned a new value of a different type, as shown below:

                >>>a = 20
                >>>a
                20
                >>>a = "hello"
                >>>a
                'hello'
              There are different ways of assigning values to variables in Python:
                 • Method1: Assigning different values to different variables on different lines.

                >>>a = 5
                >>>b = 10.5
                >>>c = "hello"
                 • Method2: Assigning different values to different variables on same line.

                >>>a = 5; b = 10.5; c = "hello"
                          OR

                >>>a, b, c = 5, 10.5, "hello"
                 • Method3: Assigning same value to different variables on same line.

                >>>a = b = c = 10

                     Python  is  a  case-sensitive  language  where  uppercase  and  lowercase  characters  have  different
                     meanings. Name and name are two different variables.




                         Data Types


                 Data types specify the kind of a value a variable can store. It helps us to identify the kind of operation that can
                 be performed on that specific data type. Every value in Python has a data type. Some of the standard built-in
                 data types of Python are:

                                                             Data Types




                             Numbers           None           Boolean        Sequences          Sets           Maps





                     int       float    complex                       string    list    tuple                dictionary

                    • Numbers: Data with a numeric value falls into this category. It can be integer, float and complex. Python will
                   automatically convert a number from one type to another if needed. Following are some number types:
                      ✶ Integer: Integers are whole numbers (+ve, -ve or 0) with no fractions or decimal value. Range of an integer in
                      Python can be from -2147483648 to 2147483647, and long integer has unlimited range subject to available
                      memory. For example, 10, 124, 4567, 7812568751.
                      ✶ Float: It is a real number with floating point representation. For example, 15.5 and 12.0. It can also be represented
                      using the exponent notation E. For example, 1E5 is 100000.
                      ✶ Complex:  It  is  made  up  of  a  real  number  and  an  imaginary  number.  For  example,  3+2j  where  3  is  a  real
                      number, 2 is an imaginary number, and j is the imaginary unit.
                    • None: This is a special data type with NULL or nothing/no value. It does not mean 0, False or empty. It is
                   represented by None.
                    • Boolean: It is a data type with two built-in values: True or False. It is used in logical evaluation. A True value
                   represents 1 while a False represents 0.
                    • Sequence: It is a collection of data stored under a common name. Each value is referred by its index number. It
                   can be mutable or non-mutable. There are three types of data as sequence in Python:
                      ✶ String: It is an ordered sequence of UNICODE characters enclosed in single or double quotes. Multi-line strings
                      can be created using triple quotes (single or double). The quotes are not part of string. They only tell the
                      computer where the string constant begins and ends. Its length is dependent on the available memory. It can
                      also be empty where we have just empty quotes with no value. For example,
                            " "
                            "Hello"

                            'Python'
                            "I love 'Python'"

                    line breaks and multiple paragraphs without using special characters like \n for newline. Multiline strings are
                    defined by enclosing the text within triple quotes, either single (''') or double (""") quotes. For example,

                          '''It is
                          an interesting

                    values are separated by comma and are enclosed in square brackets [ ]. They are mutable data types as the
                    values of these data types can be changed by the user after creation. For example,

                    ✶ Tuples:  It  is  a  sequence  of  heterogeneous  values  arranged  as  elements  and  are  referred  by  an  index
                    number. These values are separated by comma and are enclosed in circular brackets ( ). They are immutable
                    as the values of these data types cannot be changed by the user after creation.

                          mytuple=("Amit","Shweta","Peter","Zoya")
                          Marks=(89,92,93,78,89)

                 • Set:  A  set  is  a  collection  of  unique  elements  that  is  both  mutable  and  unordered.  Sets  are  defined  using
                 curly  brackets  {}  with  elements  separated  by  commas.  Each  element  in  a  set  must  be  unique.  Sets  are
                 commonly  used  for  tasks  that  involve  mathematical  operations  like  union,  intersection,  and  difference.
                 For example,
                 mySet = {21, 52, 33, 54, 95}
                 • Dictionary: In Python, a dictionary is a data type that stores a collection of Key : Value pairs. Each key is unique
                 within the dictionary, and it maps to a corresponding value. Dictionary is represented by curly braces {} with
                 each pair separated by a colon (:). Dictionaries are mutable, meaning they can be modified after creation.
                 For example, person = {'name': 'Yash', 'Department': 'Sales', 'city': 'Delhi'}

              Data Type Conversion

              The process of converting value of one data type to another is called type conversion or type casting. This is
              useful when you need to perform operations involving mixed types.

              Python supports two types of type conversion:
              1.   Implicit Type Conversion

              2.   Explicit Type Conversion
              1.    Implicit Type Conversion: In implicit type conversion, when Python encounters mixed data types, it
                 automatically converts one data type to another data type to avoid data loss and ensure compatibility. This
                 process doesn't require any user involvement.

                   # Example of implicit type conversion
                   a = 5                        # Integer
                   b = 2.0                     # Float

                   # Adding an integer and a float
                   result = a + b

                     print(type(result))   # Output: <class 'float'>
                 2.    Explicit  Type  Conversion:  Explicit  type  conversion,  also  known  as  type  casting,  is  performed  by  the
                    programmer using predefined functions to convert one data type to another. This is necessary when you
                    need to ensure that a specific type is used for an operation or when Python does not automatically convert
                    the types.

                 Common Functions for Explicit Type Conversion
                    • int(): Converts a value to an integer.

                    • float(): Converts a value to a float.
                    • str(): Converts a value to a string.
                    • bool(): Converts a value to a boolean.
                    • list(), tuple(), set(), etc.: Convert to respective data structures.
                 Examples:

                   >>> float(12)
                   12.0
                   >>> int(15.5)

                   15
                   >>> str(12)
                       '12'
                   >>> int(True)
                       1
                   >>> bool(0)
                       False
                 You can get the data type of any object by using type( ) function. For example,
                   >>> type(10)

                   <class 'int'>
                   >>> type("abc")
                   <class 'str'>
                   >>> type(14.5)

                   <class 'float'>

                         Comments in Python

                 Comments are used to increase the readability of the code. We use them to give a proper understanding of the
                 code in simple English statements. They are completely ignored by the Python interpreter. It is always a good
                 practice to add comments in your code so that if anybody in the future wishes to understand or modify your
                 code, then through comments it will be easy to interpret the instructions. There are two different ways of writing
                 comments in Python. Let us learn about them in detail.

                 Single Line Comment

                 Single line comment starts with hash symbol # followed by the text to be written as a comment that lasts until
                 the end of the line.

                                                                                        Introduction to Python  387]]></page><page Index="390"><![CDATA[For example,

              # assigning a value to a variable
                    num1 = 10

                    num2 = 20
              # calculating the average
                    (num1 + num2) / 2


              Multiple Line Comments
              When we add up comments which occupy two or more lines then we begin the comment with either 3 times
              single quotes ''' or double quotes """, followed by text on multiple lines and end with single quotes ''' or double
              quotes """ to mark the end of the comment. For example,

                """This program calculates
                    the average of

                    two numbers stored in
                    two different variables"""
                    a = 10

                    b = 20
                    c = (a + b) / 2

                       The print() Function


              The print() function is used to print an output on the screen. It converts the expressions into a string before
              writing to the screen. Syntax to use the print( ) function is:

              print(object(s), sep = separator, end = end)
              Where,
                 • object can be one or more separated by comma and it can be a variable, literal, expression. An object will be
                 converted to string before printed.
                 • sep parameter specifies the separator between the items you want to print. By default, the separator is a space.
                 You can change this to any string you want.
                 • end parameter allows you to specify what to print at the end of the output. By default, end is set to a newline
                 character ('\n'), which means each print statement will end with a new line.

              Following are some of the examples of the print( ) function:

                                            Commands                                          Output

                    print("hello")                                                hello
                    print("hello", "friends")                                     hello friends
                    print("hello" + "friends")                                    hellofriends

                    (This is concatenation of string using "+"
                    operator)

                    print("hello", "friends", sep="$")                            hello$friends

                 NOTE:  sep and end are always the last two parameters after the objects in the print statements. However both
                       may have interchange positions.


                     print(10,20 ,sep="+",end="!")
                 OR
                     print(10,20, end="!",sep="+")
                 Output in both the cases will be same as both the statements are interpreted as same.


                         The input() Function


                 The input() function is used to take input from the user. When this statement executes then the flow of the
                 program stops and waits with the cursor blinking for the user to enter a value. The input given by the user is
                 always a string value in Python.

                 The syntax to use the input() function is:

                     input(prompt)
                 Where prompt is a string that works as a message for the user at the time of input. For example,
                    name = input("enter your name: ")

                   print(name)
                 When the preceding statement executes, it will ask to enter a name. When you enter the name and press the
                 Enter key, the entered name will be displayed on the screen:

                   enter your name: Chirag
                   Chirag
                 Let us take another example:

                   a = input("Enter first number: ") #line 1
                                                                                        Introduction to Python  389]]></page><page Index="392"><![CDATA[b = input("Enter second number: ") #line 2
                c = a + b
                print("The sum of", a ,"and", b ,"is", c)
              If we execute the preceding code and enter 4 and 5 as the values of the first and second numbers, then the
              answer will be 45 instead of 9. This is because Python considers every input value as a string. If we want to
              perform mathematical calculations, then we have to convert the taken input explicitly by using int( ) or
              float( ) functions. The syntax to convert an input value into an integer or float type is:

                a = int(input(prompt))                                  # to convert into integer
                b = float(input(prompt))                                # to convert into float
              Let us create the preceding program again by using the int( ) function.

                a = int(input("Enter first number: ")) #line 1

                b = int(input("Enter second number: ")) #line 2
                c = a + b
                print("The sum of", a ,"and", b ,"is", c)
              Now, the program will display the correct output as 9.


                       Errors in Python

              Sometimes, while writing a code we might make mistakes. These mistakes are called errors. There are three kinds
              of errors which a programmer encounters in Python: syntax error, logical error and runtime error. Let us learn
              about them in detail.

              Syntax Error

              Syntax refers to the rules for writing code in the Python language. A syntax error occurs when these rules are
              violated. This is the most common type of error made by a programmer. Syntax errors can result from typing
              errors, incorrect indentation, or providing incorrect arguments to a function. When Python encounters a syntax
              error, it cannot interpret the instruction and will raise an error. In IDLE, syntax errors are highlighted by an arrow,
              indicating the line where the error occurred. You can then go to that line to rectify the error. Some examples of
              syntax errors include:
                a + b = c
                SyntaxError: cannot assign to operator

                myname = Arshia
                SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal

                a = 5
                b = 10
                  c = a + b
                SyntaxError: unexpected indent

                print("Python"))
                SyntaxError: unmatched ')'

              Logical Error
              This kind of error is difficult to find since the program will run correctly but the desired output is not achieved.
              This happens if we give a wrong formula for the calculation to be done, write wrong logic for the problem to be
              solved through the code.

                 To calculate the average:

                   p = marks1 + marks2 / 2 #instead of (marks1+marks2) / 2
                 Preceding code produces a wrong output due to the logical error in formula. Let us take another example. To
                 find the perimeter of rectangle,

                   p = 2 * l + b            #instead of p = 2 * (l + b)

                 Runtime Error
                 Runtime errors occur during the execution of a program and can result from various issues such as incorrect
                 input or output, undefined object errors, or division by zero errors. These errors can halt the program's execution
                 unexpectedly, making them challenging to debug.
                 Example of runtime error is:

                   a = int(input("enter first number"))
                   b = int(input("enter second number"))
                   c = a / b
                 If a = 5 and b = 0, then it will display:
                    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

                         Control Statements


                 As you know that a program is a set of instructions given to a computer to do a specific task. The order of
                 execution of these instructions controls the flow of a program. There are three important ways to control the
                 flow of a program which are interpreted by any programming language in a structured manner. These are:
                    • Sequential Statements
                    • Selection Statements
                    • Iterative Statements
                 Let us learn about these in detail.


                         Sequential Statements

                 A step-by-step process of executing code is called sequential flow of control. This is the default flow of execution
                 of a program. It means that the computer will run the code one line at a time starting from line 1, followed by
                 line 2 and so on until it reaches the last line of the program.

                 Let us take an example of making a mango smoothie. The steps will be:
                 1.  Put mango pieces in a Mixer jar
                 2.  Add sugar
                 3.  Add milk
                 4.  Churn the mixer jar

                         Selection Statements


                 In Python,
                    • Selection flow of control is achieved through conditional statements.
                    • In  the  conditional/selection  statements,  flow  of  control  is  changed  based  on  a  condition.  We  specify  the
                   condition in the program, which evaluates to either 'True' or 'False'.
                    • If condition is 'True' then the block of statement written for 'True' will be executed, and if the condition is 'False'
                   then the block of statements for 'False' will be executed.
                    • Conditional statements are also called branching statements because a program decides which statement to
                   execute based on the result of the evaluated condition.
                    • A block is identified by using an indentation (minimum 1 space). Ensure that all statements in one block are
                   indented at the same level.
                    • Python mainly provides three types of conditional statements—if, if…else and if…elif…else statements.
                 Let us learn about them in detail.


                 The if Statement
                 We use the if statement to do conditional programming. Condition with the if statement can also be written
                 within the parenthesis ( ). However, it is optional to use parenthesis. It is mandatory to specify colon (:) after
                 writing a condition with the if statement. The number of statements (also called as a Block) written within if
                 statement can be of any size. A statement or block of statement will be executed only when the condition is
                 'True'. If the condition is 'False' then nothing happens.
                 The syntax of the if is as follows:
                 if (condition):

                     statements
                 Where,
                    • if is a keyword.

                    • condition can be any relational or logical expression.
                    • statements are always indented can be single or a block.

              The if…elif…else Statement
              When there are multiple conditions in a program then it is handled by using elif statement. It means if the
              previous condition is not 'True' then try this condition written next to elif. If one condition is 'True' then the
              statements below it will be executed and the rest of the conditions given using elif will be ignored. In case all
              the conditions written with elif are not 'True', then the statements written just below the else statement will
              be executed. The syntax of the if…elif…else statement is as follows:

              if (condition1):
                Statements 1
              elif (condition2):
                Statements 2
              elif (condition3):
                Statements 3
              ...
              else:
                Statements executed when all above conditions are False
              Where
                 • if, else, elif are keywords.
                 • condition1, condition2 and condition3, …., can be any expression.

                 • statements1, statements2 and statements3 are always indented can be single or a block of statements.

              In Python, the process of repeating a set of instructions based on a condition is called loop or iteration. There
              are two types of loops in Python—for loop and while loop. Let us learn about them in detail.

              The for Loop

              The for loop is used to repeat a set of instructions for a fixed number of times. This means the number of
              iterations are known/definite before we start the execution of the loop. Therefore, the for loop is also known
              as definite loop. Indentation of statements is must to specify the block of statements to be repeated using the
              for loop. There are commonly two different ways of using the for loop:
                 • Using Sequence: In this type of for loop, a sequence of values is used over which the loop iterate. The syntax
                 to use the for loop with a sequence is:

                for <counter variable> in <sequence>:
                    Statements
                 Where,
                    ✶ for is a keyword.

                    • Using the range() Function: The range( ) function is an inbuilt function that is used to generate a sequence
                   of values between the specified range. The syntax to use the for loop with a range () function is:

                    for <Var> in range(<Start>, <End>, <Step>):

                       Statements
                    Where,

                      ✶ for, in, and range are keywords.
                      ✶ Start, End, and Step are parameters of range() function and will always be integers.
                      ✶  Start is a starting value of loop, End is an ending value (not inclusive) of loop, and Step is the number of steps
                      taken to reach the end value.
                      ✶ If only two parameters are used then Step value becomes 1 by default.

                      ✶  If only one parameter is used the Start becomes 0 and Step becomes 1 by default.
                      ✶ If Start > End then Step should be a negative integer.
                      ✶ If Start < End then Step should be a positive integer.
                      ✶ If Start >= End and Step value is not specified, the loop will not execute as this is an invalid condition.

              The while Loop
              The while loop is used to repeat a set of instructions as long as the condition is true. It means when the number
              of iterations are not fixed/indefinite before we start with the execution of a loop. Therefore, it is known as an
              indefinite loop. Indentation of statements is must to specify the block of statements to be repeated using while
              loop.
              This loop is also called an entry-controlled loop as it checks for the condition in the beginning. If the condition
              is 'True' then the body of the loop will be executed. If the condition is 'False' then it will not be allowed to enter
              within the loop and it stops. The syntax of the while loop is:

                while <condition>
                    Statements
              Where,

                 • while is a keyword.
                 • condition is a criterion to repeat the instructions. The instructions repeat until the condition is 'True'. As soon
                 as the condition is 'False', the control exits from the loop.
                 • Statements are always indented can be single or a block and are repeated till the condition is True.

                       When there is no change of condition in while loop then it becomes infinite loop, For example,
                                       i=1

                                  while i<6:
                                    print(i)
                       In the above code, the value of i will always be 1, and due to this, the condition will always be
                       True and will keep on executing the statement inside for an infinite number of times.

                       Lists in Python


              A list in Python is a collection of items that are ordered and mutable (changeable). It can contain elements of
              different data types, such as strings, integers, floats, objects, or even other lists. Each value in a list is called an
              element, and each element is indexed based on its position in the list. The index starts at 0 for the first element,
              1 for the second element, and so on. The number of elements in a list determines its length. Lists are defined by
              enclosing the elements within square brackets [], with each element separated by a comma. For example,

              my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'hello', 5.0]
              Lists are mutable, meaning that you can change the elements in a list after it has been created. You can add
              elements to a list, modify existing elements, or remove elements from a list.

                 Based on the above definition, the list has the following important features:
                    • It is mutable data type.
                    • It is an ordered sequence of values.
                    • Each element is separated by comma and enclosed in square brackets [ ].
                    • Each value/element is accessed by an index number.

                    • The values can be added, modified or deleted by the user throughout the program.
                    • It stores the values of different data types.

                 Creating a List

                 A list is created by enclosing the values within square brackets. Each value/element is separated by a comma
                 and stored under a common name. These values can be of different data types. The name follows the rules of
                 naming conventions for identifiers as shown below:

                                 Examples                                          Commands
                   Creating an empty list                 list1 = []
                   Creating a list with single value      list2 = [56]

                   Creating a list of friends             friends = ["Saisha", "Advika", "Arshia"]
                   Creating a list of marks               marks=[92, 91, 89, 95, 93]

                   Creating a list of students with roll no  students = [21, "Gunjan", 94.5, 34, "Rohit",
                   and percentage (list of mixed values)  91.3]
                   Creating a list within another list    section = ["A", 25, "English", ["B",34], ["C",37],

                                                          56.7]
                   Creating a list with repeated values   L1 = [10] * 5  # L1 will have [10, 10, 10, 10,

                                                          10]
                   Creating  a  list  from  another  sequence  alpha  =  list("hello")  #string  converted  to  a
                   or string using list( ) function       list #output will ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
                   Values input from the user in a list   L1 = list(input("enter numbers :"))


                 Accessing the Elements of a List

                 The elements of a list can be accessed by using its index number starts with 0 (zero). There are two different
                 ways of using the index number:
                    • Positive/Forward Indexing: The index number begins with 0 till length-1 and we refer the elements from left
                   to right.
                    • Negative/Backward Indexing: The index number begins with -1 till -length and we refer the elements from
                   right to left. For example,
                            L1 = ['P', 'Y', 'T', 'H', 'O', 'N']


                                 Forward Indexing      0    1     2    3    4     5

              Traversing a List
              Traversing means visiting each element and processing it as required by a program. We use a loop to traverse a
              list. There are different ways of visit each element as shown below:

                                                 Commands                                         Output

              Using + Operator with List

              The + operator is used to concatenate the list with another list. Remember that both the operands on either side
              of the + operator have to be a list only otherwise it gives an error. For example,

                                  Commands                                          Output

                    B = [4, 5, 6]
                    C = A + B
                    print(C)

                    A = [1, 2, 3]                            [4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3]
                    B = [4, 5, 6]

                 Using * Operator with List
                 The * operator is used to replicate a list by a specific number of times. With * operator, one operand has to be a
                 list and the other should only be an integer, otherwise it will give an error. For example,
                                Commands                                    Output

              The comparison of the lists is done using comparison operators >, <, >=, <=, != and ==. These operators
              compare the elements in lexicographical order (alphabetically order). For example, if corresponding elements
              are same, it goes to the next element, and so on until it finds elements that differ. For example,

                    l1 = [1, 2, 3]
                    l2 = [1, 2, 3]

              Slicing a List
              Slicing a list means accessing a specific portion of a list. This can be done by using a range of index values with
              start index number, end index number separated by colon. We can use both forward index and backward index
              to specify the range of slicing in a list. Some important points to consider to do slicing in a list are:
                 • Elements from beginning to a range - list[ : index] or [ : -index]
                 • Elements from specific Index till the end - list[index:]

                 • Elements within a range - list[start index : end index]
                 • Elements within range using step value - list[start index : end index : step value]
                 • Whole list in forward order - list[ : ] OR list[::] or list[0: len(list)]
                 • Whole list in reverse order - list[ : : -1].

              For example,

              word = ['E', 'D', 'U', 'C', 'A', 'T', 'I', 'O', 'N']

                        Forward Indexing      0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8

                 Adding New Elements to a List
                 There  are  three  different  functions  used  to  add  elements  in  an  existing  list  which  are  append( ),
                 extend( ) and insert( ). Let us learn about them in detail.


                 The append( ) Function
                 The append( ) function appends a single element with the given value(any datatype) at the end of the list. We
                 use this function in a loop for adding multiple elements. With the single append( ) function, the length of the
                 list will increase by 1. The syntax of the append( ) function is:

                    list.append(item)
                 where, item can be any value like number, string, list, etc. For example,



                                                                                        Introduction to Python  409]]></page><page Index="412"><![CDATA[Commands                                            Output

                 for i in range(5):                                     Enter Friend Name: Swati

                       nm=input("Enter Friend Name: ")                  Enter Friend Name: Sudhir
                       friends.append(nm)                               Enter Friend Name: Shashi

                 print(friends)                                         ['Amit', 'Sneha', 'Swati', 'Sudhir', 'Shashi']

                 wild = ['tiger', 'lion']
                 pets.append(wild)

                 print(pets)

              The extend( ) Function
              The extend() function is used to append multiple values at a time in a list. The syntax of the extend()
              function is:
                 list.extend(iterable value)
              where iterable value can be a list. For example,


                                          Commands                             Output

                                m=[5]
                                n.extend(m)

                                print(n)
                                pets  =  ['cat',  'dog',  ['cat', 'dog', 'rabbit', 'tiger', 'lion']
                                'rabbit']
                                wild=['tiger', 'lion']

                 The insert() function is used to add a single value at a specific position in an existing list. The length of the
                 list will increase by one. The syntax of the insert() function is:


                   list.insert(index, value)
                 For example,

                                                 Commands                          Output


                                      L = [10, 20, 30]                   [10, 40, 20, 30]
                                      L.insert(1, 40)
                                      print(L)
                                      L = [10, 20, 30]                   ['abc', 10, 20, 30]

                                      a = "xyz"
                                      L.insert(2, a)

                                      print(L)
                                      L = [10, 20, 30]                   [10, ['a', 'b'], 20, 30]
                                      L.insert(1, ["a", "b"])
                                      print(L)


                 Modifying Existing Values in a List
                 List is mutable so data can be easily modified by overwriting a new value to an existing value in a given list by
                 using an assignment operator (=). Syntax to modify existing values in a list is:

                   list[index] = newvalue
                 For example,

                                            Commands                             Output


                                   L1=[10,20,40,50]                [10, 20, 40, 100]
                                   L1[3]=100
                                   print(L1)

                                   L1=[10,20,40,50]                [10, 'abc', 'xyz', 100]
                                   L1[1:3]=["abc","xyz"]
                                   print(L1)


                 Removing Elements from a List

                 There are two different functions used to remove elements in an existing list remove() and pop(). Let us learn
                 about these functions in detail.





                                                                                        Introduction to Python  411]]></page><page Index="414"><![CDATA[The remove( ) Function

              The remove() function removes the first occurrence of the element with the specified value. It means only one
              value can be removed at a time even if there are duplicate values in the list. If you wish to remove multiple values
              then this function can be used within a loop where it repeats itself a specific number of times. The syntax of the
              remove() function is:

                 list.remove(<single value>)
              For example,

                                          Commands                                      Output

                       marks = [23, 34, 23, 45, 56, 78, 56]              [34, 23, 45, 56, 78, 56]
                       marks.remove(23)
                       print(marks)
                       marks = [23, 34, 23, 45, 56, 78, 56]              [23, 34, 23, 45, 78, 56]
                       marks.remove(56)
                       print(marks)
                       marks = [23, 34, 23, 45, 56, 78, 56]              ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list

                       marks.remove(72)
                       print(marks)

              The pop( ) Function

              The pop() function removes an element from the list based on the index number specified in the function and
              returns the deleted value. In case no index number is given then by default it removes the last element from the
              list. If we try to remove an index number which does not exist then it gives an IndexError.

              For example,
                                          Commands                                     Output

                        vowels=['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']                i
                        val=vowels.pop(2)
                        print(val)
                        vowels=['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']                u
                        val=vowels.pop()
                        print(val)
                        vowels=['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']                IndexError: pop index out of range
                        val=vowels.pop(6)
                        print(val)
                        lst=[]                                          IndexError: pop from empty list
                        lst.pop()

              Some other Functions Used with List

              There are some other functions also available to use with the list which are as follows:
                 • len(): This function returns the length of a list. For example,

                      marks = [10, 34, 42, 21, 45]
                       print(len(marks))

                    • clear(): This function removes all the elements of the list in one go. It empties the list but the empty list still
                   exists in Python which can be used later to fill the values. For example,
                    city=["Delhi", "Mumbai", "Kolkata", "Chennai"]


                   city.clear()
                   print(city)

                    Output: [ ]
                    • reverse(): This function reverses the content of the list "in place". For example,
                    alpha = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']


                   alpha.reverse()
                   print(alpha)
                    Output: ['e', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'a']
                    • sort(): This function sorts the list in ascending or descending order. This is done "in the list itself" and works for
                   the list with values of the same data types. For example,

                         city=["Delhi", "Mumbai", "Kolkata", "Chennai"]
                          city.sort() #sorts the list by default in ascending order
                          print(city)
                    Output: ["Chennai", "Delhi", "Kolkata", "Mumbai"]
                         city.sort(reverse=True)#sorts the list descending order
                    Output: ["Mumbai", "Kolkata", "Delhi", "Chennai"]

                    • index(): It returns the index number of the value given in the function. For example,
                    city=["Delhi", "Mumbai", "Kolkata", "Chennai"]

                   print (city.index("Kolkata"))
                    Output: 2
                    print (city.index("Pune"))
                    Output: ValueError: 'Pune' is not in list

                    It returns ValueError exception if the value is not found in the list.
                    • count(): This function counts the number of occurrences of the specified value in the given list. If the value
                   doesn't exist, then the function returns 0. For example,
                    marks = [56, 67, 45, 78, 56, 78, 12]

                   marks.count(78)
                    Output: 2
                   marks.count(10) # 10 does not exist in the list.
                    Output: 0

                   Ans.  Computer problem-solving involves several steps, which are as follows:
                       •  Understanding the problem
                       •  Analysing the problem

                       •  Developing the solution
                       •  Coding and implementation

                    5.  How did Python get its name?
                   Ans.  Guido van Rossum designed Python and released in 1991. He wanted to give a unique name to it. So, he named it after
                       the famous BBC comedy TV show "Monty Python's Flying Circus".
                    6.  Why is Python considered as a high-level language?

                   Ans.  Python  is  a  high-level  and  general-purpose  programming  language  which  simplifies  the  process  of  developing  a
                       program. The code written in Python is more close to human language and away from machine language.
                    7.  Name different modes of working in Python.

                   Ans.  The two different modes of working in Python are:
                       •  Interactive Mode
                       •  Script Mode
                    8.  What are tokens in Python? Name a few of them.

                   Ans.  Tokens are the smallest meaningful unit of a program. Tokens supported by Python are Keywords, Identifiers, Literals,
                       Operators and Punctuators.
                    9.  What is the use of 'if' statement in Python?

                   Ans.  In 'if' statement, a statement or block of statement will be executed only when the condition is True. If the condition is
                       False then nothing happens.
                    10.  How is a block of statements identified in Selection or Iteration?

                   Ans.  A block is identified by using an indentation (minimum 1 space). Ensure that all statements in one block are indented
                       at the same level.
                    11.  What is iteration?

                   Ans.  Iteration refers to the process of repeating a set of instructions based on a condition.
                    12   What is the use of the + operator with lists?
                   Ans.  The + operator is used to concatenate a list with another list.

                    13.  What do you mean by traversing a list?

                   Ans.  Traversing a list means to visit each element and process it as required by a program.
                    14.  What is the use of the pop( ) function?
                   Ans.  The pop( ) function removes an element from the list based on the index number specified in the function and returns
                       the deleted value.


                 B.  Long answer type questions:
                    1.  What is sequential flow? Explain with an example.





                                                                                        Introduction to Python  419]]></page><page Index="422"><![CDATA[Ans.  In  sequential  flow,  the  statements  are  placed  one  after  the  other  and  the  flow  of  execution  occurs  starting  from
                    line 1, line 2 and so on with a top to down approach. It is the default flow followed in any programming language. For
                    example, the steps for calculating the percentage of any student
                    1.  Input marks of English, Hindi, and Math

                    3.  Calculate the percentage
                    4.  Display the percentage
                  2.  Explain the important symbols of flowchart.

                Ans.     Symbol              Description
                         Oval                Used to start and end a flowchart.
                         Parallelogram       Used for input and output operation.

                         Rectangle           Used for assignment, mathematical operations,
                                             processing

                         Diamond             Used for decision-making in case of branching
                                             or looping.
                         Arrow               Used  to  show  the  direction  of  the  flow  of
                                             information.
                  3.  Explain the use of print( ) function with all its parameters.
                Ans.  The print() function is used to print an output on the screen. It converts the expressions into a string before writing to
                    the screen. Syntax to use the print( ) function is:
                        print(object(s), sep = separator, end = end)

                     Where,
                    •  object can be one or more separated by comma and it can be a variable, literal, expression. An object will be
                      converted to string before printed.
                    •  sep is used as a separator if there are more than one objects.
                    •  end specifies what to print at the end. Default is newline '\n'.
                  4.  Give two different ways of writing statements in Python.
                Ans.  •   Simple statements: By default, the end of a statement is done by pressing an Enter key. Each statement is
                      written on a new line.
                       a=5 is a simple statement where variable-a is created with value 5.
                       c=a + b

                    •  Multiline Statements:  We  can  make  a  statement  that  extends  over  multiple  lines  by  using  line  continuation
                      character (\) as shown below:

                       a = 4 + 5 +\
                       6 + 7 +\
                       8 + 9
                    •  The main advantage of using multiline is when we need to do long calculations and cannot fit these statements into
                      one line.
                  5.  Explain if…else statement with example.
                Ans.  When the condition is 'True' then the statements indented just below the if statement will be executed and if the
                    condition is 'False' then the statements indented just below the else statement will be executed. Syntax is:
                      if (condition):

                             Statements for False
                       Example:
                         age=int(input("Enter your age: "))

                         if (age>=18):
                             print("Eligible for driving")
                         else:
                             print("Not eligible")
                    6.  Explain "for" loop with an example.
                   Ans.  It is used to repeat a set of instructions for a fixed number of times. This means when the number of iterations are
                       known/definite before we start the execution of the loop. It is therefore also known as definite loop. Indentation of
                       statements is must to specify the block of statements to be repeated using for loop.
                       There are two ways to use for loop:
                       •  Using sequence
                       •  Using range() function
                       Example:
                       for i in range(10, 0, -1):

                           print(i)
                    7.  Explain while loop with example.
                   Ans.  It is used to repeat a set of instructions as long as the condition is true. It means when the number of iterations are not
                       fixed/indefinite before we start with the execution of a loop. Therefore, it is known as an indefinite loop. Indentation of
                       statements is must to specify the block of statements to be repeated using while loop.
                       This loop is also called an entry-controlled loop as it checks for the condition in the beginning only. If the condition is
                       'True' then the body of the loop will be executed. If the condition is 'False' then it will not be allowed to enter within the
                       loop and it stops. The syntax of the while loop is:

                       while <condition>:
                           statements
                       Where,
                       while is a keyword.
                       condition is a criterion to repeat the instructions. The instructions repeat till the condition is 'True'. As soon as the
                       condition is 'False', the control exits from the loop.
                       Statements are always indented can be single or a block and are repeated till the condition is 'True'.
                       For example,

                       i = 1
                       while i < 6:
                           print(i)
                           i += 1
                    8.  What is negative indexing? Explain with an example.

                   Ans.  In negative indexing, the index number begins with -1 till -length and we refer the elements from right to left.
                       For example, book=['C', 'O', 'M', 'P', 'U', 'T', 'E', 'R']
                       So, each letter gets an element number starting from -1
                       print(book[2:4]) will give an output ['M', 'P']
                       print(book[-7:-3]) will give an output ['O', 'M', 'P', 'U']
                                                                                        Introduction to Python  421]]></page><page Index="424"><![CDATA[9.  How can we modify elements in a list?
                Ans.  List is mutable so data can be easily modified by overwriting a new value to an existing value in a given list by using an
                    assignment operator (=).
                     Syntax:

                     list[index] = newvalue
                     For example,
                    l1 = [10, 20, 40, 50]
                     l1[3] = 100

                         l1[1:3]=["abc","xyz"]
                         print(l1)


                       b. names=["yash","amit","rhea","mayank"]      ['amit', 'mayank', 'rhea', 'yash']
                          names.sort()
                          print(names)

                      c. A=[10,20,34,56,"abc","xyz",89.5,67]         [10, 20, 34, 56, 'xyz', 89.5]
                          A.remove("abc")
                          A.pop()
                          print(A)

                      d. l1=[1,2,3,4,5,6]                            [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1]

                    1.  What type of language is Python?

                   Ans.  Python is a scripting language.
                    2.  How is Python an interpreted language?
                   Ans.  Python  is an  interpreted  language  because  it executes code  line by  line at  runtime  without  compiling into
                       machine-level code beforehand.
                    3.  What are Python modules?

                   Ans.  Python modules are files containing Python code. This code can either be functions classes or variables. A Python
                       module is a .py file containing executable code.
                    4.  Name some commonly used built-in modules in Python.
                   Ans.  Some of the commonly used built-in modules are:
                       a.  os                                            b.  sys
                       c.  math                                          d.  random
                       e.  datetime                                      f.  JSON

                    5.  Is Python case-sensitive?
                   Ans.  Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language.

                    6.  Is indentation required in Python?
                   Ans.  Indentation is necessary for Python. It specifies a block of code. All codes within loops, classes, functions, etc. are
                       specified within an indented block. It is usually done using four space characters. If your code is not indented necessarily,
                       it will not execute accurately and will throw errors as well.
                    7.  How do you write comments in Python?
                   Ans.  Comments in Python start with a # character. However, alternatively at times, commenting is done using docstrings
                       (strings enclosed within triple quotes).
                    8.  What is the purpose of is, not, and in operators?
                   Ans.  Operators are special functions. They take one or more values and produce a corresponding result.
                       a.  is: returns true when 2 operands are true (Example: "a" is 'a').

                       b.  not: returns the inverse of the boolean value.
                       c.  in: checks if some element is present in some sequence.
                    9.  What does len() do?

                   Ans.  It is used to determine the length of a string, a list, an array, etc.
                    10.  Is Python an interpreted language?
                   Ans.  Yes, Python is an interpreted language.
                    11.  Is Python Object-Oriented Language?

                   Ans.  Yes, Python is an Object-Oriented Language.
                    12.  How many modes are available in Python?

                Ans.  The "+" operator adds values on either side of the operator.
                 22.  What is the use of the "*" operator?

                Ans.  The "**" operator multiplies values on either side of the operator.
                 23.  What is the use of "%" operator?
                Ans.  The "%" operator divides the left-hand operand by the right-hand operand and returns the remainder.
                 24.  What is the use of "**" operator?
                Ans.  The "*" operator performs exponential (power) calculation on operators.

                 25.  What is the use of the "==" operator?
                Ans.  It checks if the value of two operands is equal or not. It returns True if the values are equal, otherwise False.
                 26.  What is the use of the "!=" operator?

                Ans.  It checks if the value of two operands is equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true.
                 27.  Why do you use the "<>" operator?
                Ans.  The "<>" operator historically was used in some programming languages, including older versions of Python, to denote
                    inequality. However, in Python, the preferred and standard operator for inequality is "!=" (not equal to).
                 28.  Describe the use of the ">" operator.
                Ans.  It checks if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand, if yes then condition becomes

                 For the above problem, the data needed is the average consumption of water in the households for various
                 activities  based  on  Season  and  Region.  The  data  points  would  be  House  No.,  Location,  Location  Type
                 (Metro/Urban/Village), Source of water (Piped/Well/Tube Well), Month, Activity, Water Consumed in Liters,
                 Gender, Adult/Child. The sample size from each location should be reasonable enough to represent the
                 location. Location selection needs to be in a way that covers all types of topography like Desert, Plain,
                 Mountain, Coastal Area, Metropolitan, Urban, or Village.





























                 AI Solution
                 Today in general there is no systematic analysis of water requirement per household and the basis of the
                 supply of water in that area. Today the supply is based on the availability of water in that area to supply.
                 Which creates abundance in some areas, and shortage in others. This thereby leads to gross misuse of this
                 scarce resource available to us in the areas of abundance supply. There is also no use of recycled water in
                 the households as the supply of the same is not there.
                 To solve the same for our future generations, we need to work on it now and for this things can start by
                 laying down recycled water supply lines to the households to use for washing and in the washrooms for
                 flushing.

                 This can be started at the places, where already the supply lines are laid, and an AI model needs to be
                 introduced here to manage the supply to different areas based on the household consumption pattern in
                 that area, the kind of area it is, that is Desert would need more water than in the mountains. Gradually,
                 when the water requirements settle down over a period of time, the previous consumption pattern and
                 considering new households added, can also be considered by the AI model to determine the demand.
                 Further to make the water resources more distributed and available to areas where water is scarce, inter-
                 city supply lines can be laid, and AI model scope can be increased to manage water resources better and
                 more efficiently.
                 Rohit, an Indian, embarked on a project to redesign the water closet / flush to reduce the consumption
                 of water. He made this possible with a simple mechanism added to the conventional closet that creates a
                 partial vacuum when the user pushes down the flush lever. He called it the Vacu-Flush.
